this	is	one	of	the	best	scrooge	movies	out	.	henry	winkler	outdoes	himself	.	the	casting	is	excellent	and	the	music	and	theme	old	but	very	relevant	.
set	in	the	usa	about	the	time	of	the	depression	it	is	an	update	of	that	old	familiar	story	of	redemption	.	the	story	is	classic	and	this	one	is	as	good	as	all	the	rest	.	henry	winkler	is	good	in	this	role	.
henry	winkler	played	a	great	part	as	scrooge	.	it	gave	yet	another	twist	to	all	the	christmas	carols	of	the	past	.
it	seems	like	just	about	everybody	has	made	a	christmas	carol	movie	.	this	one	is	the	best	by	far	!	it	seems	more	realistic	than	all	the	others	and	the	time	period	seems	to	be	perfect	.	the	acting	is	also	far	better	than	any	of	the	others	i	've	seen	my	opinion	.
henry	winkler	stars	in	this	remake	of	the	classic	tale	of	scrooge	.	this	one	is	set	in	post	depression	era	america	and	is	oneof	the	best	i	've	ever	seen	.	winkler	is	equally	at	ease	as	a	young	man	with	a	girlfriend	or	an	old	man	with	an	attitude	.	i	watch	this	every	christmas	and	was	delighted	to	discover	it	on	dvd	.	you	'll	love	it	!
the	title	says	it	all	this	is	a	christmas	carol	re	done	.	henery	winkler	play	the	part	of	scrooge	in	this	american	version	of	the	timeless	classic	it	is	well	worth	the	investment	if	you	are	a	collector	of	the	christmas	carol	stories	.
henry	winkler	does	an	amazing	job	as	scrooge	in	this	tale	,	he	is	an	awesome	actor	,	i	really	like	sitting	down	to	watch	this	movie	on	a	cold	night	.
trying	to	make	dickens	relevant	again	,	this	dresses	him	up	in	american	hard	times	and	values	.	winkler	is	always	a	pleasure	to	watch	.	i	do	n't	know	,	however	,	how	winkler	would	have	dickens	speak	if	set	in	post	2007	american	,	though	.
henry	winkler	is	one	of	my	favorite	actors	of	all	time	.	he	is	wonderful	in	an	american	christmas	carol	!	this	is	another	movie	that	has	not	been	shown	at	christmas	in	the	last	few	years	,	but	should	be	.	so	glad	that	i	could	get	it	for	my	collection	of	favorite	christmas	movies	.
it	did	n't	grab	our	attention	enough	to	finish	it	.	it	was	probably	okay	if	it	was	the	first	christmas	movie	you	watched	this	season	.
this	is	my	favorite	christmas	carol	movie	.	i	have	waited	for	it	to	come	out	,	and	when	i	finally	looked	it	up	again	,	i	bought	it	!
another	entry	in	the	retelling	of	the	classic	.	ho	hum	from	start	to	finish	.	henry	winkler	is	not	believable	as	a	scrooge	type	.
christmas	brings	at	least	a	couple	of	christmas	carol	stories	.	this	one	was	more	updated	in	time	.	i	prefer	the	old	ones	,	but	it	does	n't	mean	that	this	one	was	bad	,	just	my	personal	preference	.
this	was	an	interesting	take	on	the	old	34	christmas	carol	34	movies	inspired	by	dickens	novel	.	my	husband	loved	it	.	it	is	about	people	in	the	depression	era	and	it	was	interesting	to	see	the	scenery	,	clothes	and	furniture	,	etc	.	the	acting	was	very	good	,	too	.
this	wonderful	film	is	a	total	treat	on	every	level	!	i	admit	my	reason	for	the	first	viewing	was	strictly	as	an	enthusiast	of	films	set	in	ancient	egypt	.	on	this	level	,	the	film	is	probably	the	best	i	've	seen	to	recreate	what	that	era	must	have	really	been	like	.	the	sets	and	costumes	have	a	complete	feel	of	reality	,	unlike	the	many	hollywoodized	egyptian	ventures	.	but	,	that	's	not	the	reward	i	got	by	the	end	of	the	film	.	it	's	as	much	a	tear	jerker	as	the	old	ross	hunter	lana	turner	films	!	and	,	the	performances	,	especially	that	of	paul	mercurio	in	the	title	role	,	(	why	do	n't	we	see	more	work	from	him	?	)	,	martin	landau	as	his	father	jacob	,	ben	kingsly	as	the	egyptian	over	seer	pontiphur	,	and	lesly	ann	warren	as	his	wife	,	are	exceptional	!	there	is	even	a	most	erotically	charged	scene	or	two	between	pontiphur	's	adulteress	wife	and	a	scantily	clad	joseph	.	most	everyone	already	knows	the	story	.	joseph	is	the	favored	son	of	his	father	,	inspiring	lethal	jealousy	from	his	other	sons	,	joseph	's	brothers	.	they	conspire	to	get	rid	of	joseph	,	but	ca	n't	bring	themselves	to	actually	kill	him	,	so	they	sell	him	into	slavery	.	he	ends	up	in	egpyt	and	,	over	the	years	,	thanks	to	his	talent	for	explaining	the	meanings	of	dreams	,	rises	to	a	position	of	power	second	only	to	pharaoh	.	circumstances	reunite	joseph	with	his	brothers	,	although	they	do	n't	know	who	he	is	.	the	revelation	of	his	identity	to	them	and	his	reunion	with	his	father	will	touch	the	heart	of	anyone	who	has	one	!	originally	shown	as	a	2	part	tv	mini	series	by	tnt	a	few	years	ago	,	i'm	eagerly	awaiting	the	dvd	release	uninterrupted	by	commercials	,	and	including	a	making	of	featurette	.	do	n't	let	this	jewel	get	by	you	!
this	is	a	brilliant	epic	movie	,	a	tour	de	force	,	the	best	biblical	movie	i	have	seen	with	the	exception	ofone	night	with	the	kingstarring	paul	mercurio	in	the	title	role	,	he	gives	an	intelligent	and	passionate	performance	of	a	man	who	was	prepared	to	die	,	to	keep	to	the	word	of	his	g	d	.	ben	kingsley	is	his	usual	magnificent	self	in	his	role	of	potiphar	which	he	plays	with	panache	.	warren	clark	played	a	sterling	role	as	potiphar	's	thuggish	overseer	domo	ednan	,	later	to	be	joseph	's	aid	de	camp	.	a	deliciously	evil	potiphar	's	wife	is	captured	in	brilliant	detail	by	lesley	ann	warren	and	the	actors	playing	the	ten	brothers	also	acquit	themselves	well	staying	true	to	the	form	of	israelite	tribesmanthe	movie	begins	with	the	purchase	of	joseph	by	potiphar	,	and	his	rise	from	that	of	a	lowly	slave	to	potiphar	's	major	domo	where	he	captures	the	attention	of	potiphar	's	evil	wife	,	when	he	resists	her	attention	and	she	accuses	him	of	assaulting	her	,	potiphar	soon	knows	he	is	innocent	,	and	he	embarks	on	the	telling	of	his	story	of	his	boyhood	,	including	the	narrative	of	the	rape	of	his	half	sister	dinah	(	played	with	shyness	and	prettiness	by	mexican	actress	paloma	baeza	)	,	and	the	destruction	of	the	canaanite	town	of	schechem	in	revenge	by	her	brothers	simeon	(	vincenzo	nicoli	)	and	levi	(	colin	bruce	)	then	we	move	to	the	central	story	whose	tale	baring	and	father	's	favour	lead	to	his	brother	's	brutal	attack	of	him	,	where	he	is	thrown	into	a	pit	and	sold	to	ishmaelite	traders	.	his	rise	in	prison	,	his	interpretation	of	the	dreams	of	pharaoh	(	stefano	dionisi	)	at	the	same	time	as	we	are	taken	back	to	canaan	and	see	the	story	of	tamar	(	a	pert	and	beautiful	kelly	miller	)	and	judah	(	michael	attwell	)	.	the	final	sequence	where	joseph	's	brothers	go	down	to	egypt	until	the	moving	scene	where	he	reveals	himself	to	his	brothers	is	the	finest	.	the	sex	scenes	are	tasteful	and	not	at	all	gratuitous	in	any	way	,	and	yes	this	is	an	adult	movie	,	but	they	simply	cover	what	is	told	in	the	bible	without	going	further	and	it	is	extremely	narrow	minded	to	find	them	offensive
great	great	great	!	as	with	many	of	the	other	titles	in	the	bible	collection	,	i	've	watched	this	film	several	times	and	the	emotions	i	am	left	with	after	watching	it	never	diminish	.	another	production	that	remains	true	to	the	historic	account	,	this	movie	was	casted	brilliantly	and	told	superbly	.	before	i	ever	read	the	story	of	joseph	in	the	old	testament	,	i	had	watched	this	film	.	this	movie	did	an	excellent	job	of	re	telling	the	story	.	highly	recommended	.
this	is	a	fantastic	movie	or	the	retelling	of	the	story	of	joseph	.	the	scenery	in	the	movie	is	fantastic	too	.	the	actors	are	great	in	each	of	their	roles	.	i'm	glad	i	ordered	this	movie	.	saw	it	many	years	ago	.
this	is	another	excellent	addition	to	tnt	's	bible	collection	.	it	tells	the	story	of	joseph	,	the	son	who	rose	from	a	slave	to	the	viceroy	of	egypt	.	joseph	is	the	favored	son	of	his	father	,	a	fact	which	causes	no	small	amount	of	jealousy	from	his	other	brothers	.	it	eventually	causes	so	much	resentment	that	they	sell	him	as	a	slave	to	a	passing	caravan	and	tell	his	father	that	he	was	killed	.	in	slavery	,	he	is	taken	to	egypt	.	his	intelligence	and	honest	are	both	a	curse	to	him	and	a	blessing	.	through	god	's	favor	,	and	joseph	's	steadfastness	,	he	rises	to	a	position	of	immense	power	.	when	his	brothers	come	to	him	,	seeking	help	,	they	do	not	recognize	him	and	the	stage	is	set	for	either	reconciliation	or	terrible	retribution	.	the	story	is	well	done	and	is	in	keeping	with	the	scriptures	.	at	first	,	it	can	be	a	bit	confusing	because	it	relies	on	flashbacks	that	are	not	always	immediately	apparent	but	this	is	soon	gotten	over	.	the	result	is	a	good	story	done	well	.
joseph	is	my	favorite	movie	out	of	the	bible	collection	.	i	am	going	to	get	one	movie	at	a	time	as	i	can	afford	it	until	i	have	the	whole	collection	.
there	are	no	words	accurate	enough	to	praise	this	enthralling	television	miniseries	.	joseph	is	one	of	the	most	fascinating	of	biblical	accounts	,	and	i	will	not	rehash	the	plot	since	it	is	done	superbly	by	other	reviewers	here	.	i	will	simply	say	that	this	timeless	true	account	of	a	faithful	and	courageous	young	man	is	a	wonderful	tool	to	use	with	teenagers	.	satan	has	planted	so	much	filth	in	the	movie	industry	,	and	i	praise	god	that	there	are	filmmakers	who	still	desire	to	present	the	truth	.	joseph	presents	a	magnificent	story	of	forgiveness	and	integrity	that	all	teenagers	can	learn	from	.	this	miniseries	is	one	of	the	best	biblical	retellings	in	film	fashion	i	've	ever	come	across	.	the	story	grabs	you	from	the	very	beginning	and	is	never	dull	.	paul	mercurio	is	excellent	in	his	portrayal	of	joseph	,	presenting	a	teenager	and	young	man	with	exceptional	character	.	mercurio	brings	a	vulnerability	to	this	man	that	endeared	him	to	me	at	once	.	the	scene	where	he	cries	for	mercy	after	his	brothers'	betrayal	moved	me	to	tears	.	joseph	struggles	with	temptations	and	is	flawed	like	us	all	.	ben	kingsley	is	excellent	as	potipher	,	portraying	a	man	of	integrity	and	care	.	the	actors	portraying	joseph	's	brothers	are	equally	excellent	.	several	reviewers	have	complained	about	the	scene	with	joseph	and	potipher	's	wife	,	a	femme	fatale	portrayed	with	unabashed	glee	by	leslie	ann	warren	.	this	scene	is	sexually	charged	,	but	i	believe	it	is	accurate	with	scripture	.	the	bible	does	n't	sugarcoat	things	,	nor	should	we	think	the	bible	hereos	were	not	susceptible	to	temptation	.	although	god	never	reveals	if	potipher	's	wife	was	a	temptation	to	joseph	,	i	logically	do	n't	see	how	she	could	not	have	ben	.	he	was	,	after	all	,	seventeen	when	the	attempted	seduction	took	place	.	would	n't	any	of	us	struggle	in	this	area	at	this	age	?	besides	,	seeing	joseph	struggle	makes	the	viewer	empathize	with	his	predicament	.	anyway	,	i	say	this	only	to	encourage	you	not	to	let	this	one	scene	put	you	off	.	please	give	this	wonderful	film	a	chance	.	happy	viewing	,	and	god	bless	you	.
i	recommend	this	movie	,	joseph	.	it	is	a	great	reprentation	of	of	a	truly	kind	,	just	,	and	merciful	god	and	the	people	he	loves	.	we	all	need	positive	and	true	to	life	movies	that	are	not	only	good	for	the	heart	,	but	for	the	soul	.
this	is	a	wonderful	story	of	the	beginning	rise	of	the	nation	of	israel	.	i	would	almost	rate	this	movie	as	good	as	the	ten	commandments	.	i	found	myself	in	tears	at	the	end	of	this	movie	so	new	watchers	beware	!
this	is	one	of	my	most	favorite	stories	in	the	bible	,	recommend	this	one	to	anyone	who	loves	a	good	bible	story	.
this	film	is	a	recounting	of	the	genesis	tale	of	joseph	.	joseph	is	the	most	loved	son	of	his	father	,	and	has	a	gift	for	prophecy	.	his	older	brothers	hate	him	because	of	it	and	sell	him	into	slavery	.	joseph	winds	up	in	egypt	where	he	eventually	becomes	the	second	most	powerful	man	in	the	kingdom	after	the	pharoah	.	during	a	famine	,	joseph	's	brothers	come	to	egypt	begging	for	grain	,	not	knowing	that	the	man	who	will	decide	their	fate	is	their	brother	(	whom	they	believe	to	be	dead	)	.	this	is	one	of	a	series	of	made	for	tv	movies	about	important	figures	in	the	old	testament	.	i	've	previously	reviewed	several	other	stories	in	this	series	,	but	this	is	the	best	of	a	strong	series	in	my	view	.	the	acting	is	top	notch	,	and	i	found	the	final	confrontation	between	joseph	and	his	brothers	to	be	particularly	moving	and	well	done	.	like	many	of	the	films	in	this	series	,	it	is	a	story	about	faith	and	perserverance	.	the	writer	and	producer	did	a	particularly	good	job	of	fleshing	out	the	story	of	joseph	from	genesis	without	adding	lots	of	non	biblical	threads	.	one	thing	that	i	like	about	this	movie	(	and	about	the	series	as	a	whole	)	is	that	they	are	not	overdone	.	these	are	n't	special	effects	laden	films	with	casts	of	thousands	,	but	rely	on	writing	and	good	acting	to	convey	the	tale	.	the	sets	and	the	costumes	are	realistic	and	give	the	film	a	biblical	feel	without	being	ostentatious	.	the	bottom	line	is	that	this	is	,	in	my	opinion	,	the	way	that	the	bible	should	be	brought	to	film	.
this	is	the	best	thanksgiving	special	around	.	and	i	am	not	just	saying	that	because	i	am	the	rankin	bass	historian	.	the	sound	on	this	vhs	is	magnificent	and	it	should	be	on	dvd	!	i	have	the	original	gas	lp	soundtrack	on	cd	.	maury	laws	and	jules	bass	did	a	wonderful	job	with	the	score	.	elbow	room	,	sung	by	tenn	.	ernie	ford	was	part	of	the	rankin	bass	off	broadway	play	a	month	of	sundays	,	before	it	was	put	to	great	use	in	this	special	!	a	great	special	!	e	mail	me	with	any	questions	rickgoldsc	aol	.	com
have	always	loved	the	old	movies	and	this	is	the	original	frosty	the	snowman	like	i	remember	from	my	child	hood	.	grandkids	loved	watching	it
we	all	know	the	song	.	and	surely	when	that	song	comes	to	mind	,	this	christmas	classic	special	comes	to	mind	.	originally	aired	in	1969	,	this	has	become	one	of	the	seminal	christmas	classics	along	with	other	rankin	bass	fare	as	rudolph	,	little	drummer	boy	,	and	santa	claus	is	coming	to	town	.	unlike	the	others	,	frosty	is	hand	drawn	animation	as	opposed	to	the	studio	's	typical	stop	motion	animated	specials	.	when	a	group	of	children	,	led	by	a	girl	named	karen	,	make	use	of	a	magical	hat	,	that	an	inept	magician	(	professor	hinkle	)	has	frustratingly	thrown	away	.	their	school	yard	snowman	becomes	alive	and	ready	to	spread	joy	throughout	the	town	.	awakening	with	his	trademark	happy	birthday	,	he	becomes	very	close	to	karen	and	her	friends	.	unfortunately	for	frosty	,	professor	hinkle	has	other	plans	and	seeks	to	reap	the	benefits	of	this	magical	hat	for	his	own	ends	.	for	42	years	,	this	has	been	among	the	dearest	of	christmas	specials	and	will	likely	remain	so	for	years	to	come	.	as	hard	as	many	studios	try	to	capture	that	christmas	audience	by	releasing	a	variety	of	themed	holiday	drek	(	shrek	?	.	really	?	)	,	nothing	will	ever	come	close	to	rankin	bass	and	their	series	of	specials	.
a	fabulous	christmas	time	or	anytime	video	for	kids	and	adults	.	sweet	story	of	friendship	,	sacrifice	,	loss	and	fighting	for	what	's	right	.	all	thrown	in	with	a	pinch	of	magic	in	that	old	top	hat	they	found	.	great	songs	,	great	animation	,	great	family	fun	.	what	else	can	you	say	?	if	you	've	got	kids	or	if	you	used	to	be	one	,	you	need	this	video	.
i	remember	watching	this	show	every	year	with	my	mom	.	it	is	a	great	story	to	share	with	my	kids	,	and	it	takes	me	back	to	memories	i	shared	with	my	mom	,	who	is	no	longer	with	us	.
one	of	the	best	christmas	movies	of	all	time	unique	for	it	's	time	and	still	a	favorite	of	mine	.	i	would	recommend	the	little	drummer	boy	to	anyone	,	the	real	message	of	hope	within	the	movie	will	move	hearts	.
one	of	the	few	movies	kids	can	watch	without	mom	worrying	about	inappropriate	scenes	or	information	.	perfect	for	the	holidays	.
i	bought	this	for	my	2	1	2	year	old	granddaughter	.	she	's	just	beginning	to	understand	santa	,	a	little	,	so	i	thought	this	movie	would	help	her	and	she	loves	movies	.	i	bought	this	on	vhs	for	my	daughter	when	she	was	little	and	also	bought	her	the	dvd	when	it	cam	out	.	she	's	25	,	i'm	57	and	we	both	love	this	movie	.	its	a	christmas	tradition	.
i	did	n't	watch	this	when	i	was	young	the	way	i	did	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	and	frosty	the	snowman	except	for	maybe	once	but	it	is	a	good	story	and	i	did	get	it	this	year	.	its	a	classic	the	way	those	other	to	and	a	charlie	brown	christmas	are	and	you	should	get	it	.	merry	christmas	.
the	story	starting	off	with	a	newsreel	on	the	children	of	the	world	preparing	for	a	visit	from	santa	claus	,	we	meet	a	mailman	named	special	delivery	kluger	.	after	some	introductory	comments	from	the	mailman	,	who	delivers	to	the	north	pole	in	a	snowcat	type	vehicle	,	we	see	the	credits	spelled	out	on	mail	envelopes	,	with	a	stamp	representing	the	actor	listed	.	inside	the	envelopes	are	question	from	children	around	the	world	about	santa	.	where	did	santa	's	suit	come	from	?	,	and	more	,	so	that	the	show	can	proceed	to	show	where	santa	got	his	start	and	why	things	are	the	way	they	are	.	in	a	sad	vilage	named	sombertown	,	ruthlessly	run	by	the	burgermeister	meisterberger	,	toys	are	outlawed	.	on	the	other	side	of	the	mountain	,	elves	are	raising	a	human	orphan	boy	,	learned	in	the	ways	of	toymaking	.	but	a	scary	winter	warlock	has	prevented	them	from	delivering	toys	across	the	mountain	.	whenthe	boy	grows	up	he	is	givent	he	name	kris	kringle	,	and	he	determines	to	deliver	the	toys	.	arriving	there	he	meets	ms	.	jessica	and	falls	in	love	,	but	kris	is	arrested	for	the	toys	.	after	his	escape	he	runs	into	the	winter	warlock	,	and	must	find	a	way	to	deal	with	him	if	he	is	going	to	deliver	toys	.	without	giving	any	plot	away	,	kris	has	to	find	creative	ways	to	smeak	the	toys	to	the	children	and	avoid	being	captured	again	by	the	soldiers	.	along	the	way	we	see	how	traditions	like	hanging	stockings	,	using	the	chimney	,	delivering	at	night	,	making	reindeer	fly	,	and	a	nice	naughty	list	got	their	start	.	behind	the	scenes	rankin	bass	studios	was	the	most	prolific	creators	of	holiday	specials	we	have	ever	known	.	after	the	huge	success	of	their	1964	stop	motion	musical	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	,	they	created	no	less	than	14	more	christmas	specials	,	from	a	total	of	35	specials	of	which	many	covered	other	holidays	.	in	1970	audiences	were	eager	to	see	what	the	clever	studio	would	come	up	with	next	,	their	last	picture	had	been	frosty	the	snowman	the	year	before	in	traditional	cel	animation	.	as	much	as	viewers	enjoyed	frosty	,	they	really	liked	the	stop	motion	animagic	that	was	the	specialty	of	the	studio	.	the	only	tv	specials	they	made	this	process	so	far	were	rudolph	,	and	the	little	drummer	boy	.	the	new	show	aired	on	abc	on	december	14	,	1970	and	it	was	in	animagic	!	it	was	a	one	hour	special	,	and	it	recieved	huge	ratings	.	it	still	airs	every	year	.	this	special	had	the	best	voice	casting	of	any	they	made	,	with	mickey	rooney	as	the	older	santa	,	paul	frees	as	burgermeister	,	and	keenan	wynn	as	the	winter	warlock	.	the	mailmans	voice	and	songs	were	by	the	great	fred	astaire	,	and	they	recreated	him	perfectly	in	a	mailman	figure	.	there	are	6	wonderful	songs	including	the	title	song	,	as	well	as	one	foot	in	front	of	the	other	.	the	westminster	childrens	choir	performs	as	well	.	music	and	lyrics	were	by	maury	laws	and	jules	bass	.	writing	by	the	great	romeo	muller	who	worked	on	so	many	of	their	projects	.	character	design	by	paul	coker	,	and	storyboards	and	continuity	by	don	duga	as	they	did	on	most	of	the	studios	specials	.	there	are	several	releases	on	vhs	,	laserdisc	,	and	dvd	.	all	in	all	a	terrific	show	,	i	highly	reccommend	.
if	you	like	christmas	movies	besides	the	nightmare	before	christmas	,	you	should	add	this	one	to	your	collection	.	if	you	do	n't	like	christmas	movies	then	buy	the	grinch	or	the	christmas	carol	and	see	what	you	act	like	grinch	scrooge	.	in	my	humble	opinion	this	is	the	best	telling	of	rudolph	's	story	in	a	musical	.	many	added	side	stories	with	hermey	the	dentist	,	yukon	cornelius	,	abominible	snowman	,	and	the	island	of	misfit	toys	adds	to	make	a	great	story	.	the	animated	figures	are	excellent	and	smooth	motioned	.	excellent	narration	by	burl	ives	.	the	music	is	first	rate	and	will	have	the	family	singing	along	.
i	had	to	purchase	this	dvd	.	i	wore	out	the	vhs	copy	i	had	.	television	cuts	so	much	out	for	commericals	that	it	is	a	real	pleasure	to	watch	it	as	it	was	originally	made	.
first	televised	on	nbc	tv	on	sunday	,	december	6	,	1964	(	but	usually	associated	with	cbs	tv	due	to	that	network	's	many	airings	of	the	program	throughout	the	succeeding	years	)	,	the	animated	color	tv	special	34	rudolph	,	the	red	nosed	reindeer	34	has	now	turned	forty	years	of	age	(	as	of	this	writing	)	,	and	has	endured	for	all	those	years	as	an	annual	staple	in	many	american	homes	.	the	dvd	edition	i'm	reviewing	here	is	the	one	issued	by	34	sony	wonder	34	and	34	golden	books	family	entertainment	34	(	1	disc	version	)	.	it	provides	a	very	good	looking	full	frame	(	1	.	33	1	)	video	image	of	the	perennial	34	rudolph	34	christmas	special	with	a	dolby	digital	soundtrack	recorded	in	2	channel	(	original	)	mono	.	this	particular	version	of	34	rudolph	34	is	quite	unique	actually	,	in	that	it	is	the	34	unaltered	34	version	of	the	tv	special	,	as	it	aired	originally	in	1964	.	which	means	that	one	song	which	has	been	routinely	cut	out	of	subsequent	broadcasts	of	the	program	is	presented	uncut	within	this	dvd	version	.	that	song	being	34	we	're	a	couple	of	misfits	34	,	sung	by	rudolph	and	dentist	to	be	34	hermey	34	near	the	beginning	of	the	show	.	this	song	was	replaced	in	1965	with	the	34	fame	and	fortune	34	song	instead	.	the	alternate	song	used	in	that	scene	(	34	fame	and	fortune	34	)	is	included	,	however	,	as	a	separate	bonus	feature	on	this	dvd	.	.	to	tell	you	the	truth	,	i	prefer	the	34	fame	fortune	34	number	to	the	original	34	misfits	34	tune	.	and	i	can	see	why	the	producers	of	the	special	decided	to	make	the	switch	during	the	second	broadcast	of	the	program	in	1965	.	34	f	f	34	is	a	better	ditty	,	imo	.	and	,	obviously	,	others	thought	so	as	well	.	hence	,	the	substitution	.	this	dvd	contains	the	complete	,	uncut	version	of	34	rudolph	34	(	with	a	total	run	time	of	51	minutes	,	32	seconds	)	.	this	is	significant	(	and	most	welcome	)	,	because	after	the	first	few	broadcasts	on	network	tv	,	as	we	all	know	,	many	cuts	and	edits	were	made	to	the	original	print	,	so	that	more	and	more	commercials	could	be	jammed	into	the	one	hour	network	timeslot	over	the	years	.	it	's	doubtful	we	'll	ever	encounter	this	original	34	51	minute	34	version	on	network	television	again	,	due	to	the	ever	increasing	sponsors'	demands	for	prime	time	air	time	.	all	of	the	rarely	seen	snippets	of	the	34	rudolph	34	special	are	re	inserted	into	this	full	length	dvd	version	clips	like	the	34	peppermint	34	scene	at	the	tail	end	of	the	special	,	where	yukon	cornelius	discovers	34	a	peppermint	mine	!	yahooo	!	34	.	and	the	complete	musical	numbers	(	34	jingle	,	jingle	,	jingle	!	34	and	34	we	are	santa	's	elves	34	)	are	fully	intact	on	the	dvd	whereas	,	in	many	chopped	up	prints	,	one	(	or	both	)	of	these	songs	have	either	been	severely	truncated	or	cut	out	entirely	.	it	's	nice	to	be	able	to	see	the	34	whole	34	show	via	this	nicely	done	34	sony	34	dvd	release	.	this	disc	has	a	few	nice	add	on	bonus	supplements	,	too	.	in	addition	to	the	aforementioned	bonus	song	(	34	fame	and	fortune	34	)	,	there	's	also	a	rudolph	trivia	game	,	an	original	tv	promo	,	some	ads	for	other	34	golden	books	34	holiday	dvd	titles	,	and	a	fun	and	informative	11	minute	34	introduction	34	by	producer	creator	arthur	rankin	.	in	addition	,	you	can	access	english	subtitles	in	two	different	ways	on	this	disc	there	are	the	traditional	34	captions	34	(	subtitles	)	that	can	be	turned	on	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen	.	plus	,	this	dvd	offers	what	is	called	34	read	speak	action	captions	34	,	which	show	the	words	on	the	screen	in	a	unique	,	3	d	kind	of	fashion	,	displaying	the	words	in	large	print	right	beside	the	mouths	of	each	character	speaking	,	one	word	at	a	time	.	an	interesting	alternative	to	the	normal	captioning	process	.	chapter	breaks	are	also	included	on	this	disc	,	with	a	whopping	total	of	27	34	scene	selections	34	!	my	goodness	,	some	three	hour	movie	dvds	do	n't	have	this	many	chapter	stops	!	)	note	the	34	read	speak	34	captioned	version	of	34	rudolph	34	(	which	can	be	accessed	via	the	bonus	features	area	)	does	not	have	any	34	chapter	34	breaks	included	.	an	added	word	or	two	about	the	34	tv	promo	34	on	this	disc	this	is	a	nice	little	bonus	,	which	runs	for	59	seconds	and	exhibits	very	good	color	and	overall	picture	quality	.	it	's	an	original	1966	nbc	tv	promo	that	informs	the	viewers	that	34	rudolph	is	coming	on	sunday	,	december	4th	,	on	the	general	electric	fantasy	hour	34	program	.	a	word	about	the	dvd	menus	.	i'm	not	a	big	fan	of	34	animated	menus	34	on	dvds	,	but	this	disc	's	menu	system	is	an	exception	.	for	some	reason	,	i	really	like	these	menus	,	which	offer	up	cheery	music	and	cute	animated	sequences	.	the	main	menu	puts	the	viewer	right	into	the	christmas	spirit	,	featuring	falling	snow	,	a	decorated	christmas	tree	,	and	34	rudolph	34	looking	skyward	,	complete	with	batting	eyelids	and	a	bright	glowing	nose	.	while	the	various	sub	menus	also	have	animated	moving	pictures	and	a	34	falling	snow	34	background	as	well	.	each	sub	menu	features	a	different	chara

if	you	were	alive	when	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	debuted	as	a	christmas	television	special	back	in	'64	,	you	may	recall	being	intrigued	by	it	simply	by	dint	of	its	elaboration	of	the	events	potrayed	in	gene	autry	's	well	known	song	and	in	the	various	golden	book	and	comic	book	editions	that	had	been	kicking	around	throughout	the	50s	and	early	60s	.	(	less	well	known	if	not	totally	unknown	at	that	time	would	have	been	the	orignial	1939	story	by	robert	l	.	may	.	)	nowadays	,	of	course	,	kids	grow	up	with	both	the	song	and	the	now	annually	broadcast	special	and	probably	do	n't	really	have	an	inkling	of	the	history	of	the	tale	.	but	literal	minded	kid	that	i	was	,	i	remember	being	a	little	perplexed	that	rudolph	's	father	was	donner	in	the	animated	version	.	everything	else	i	'd	ever	read	(	including	the	annual	comic	book	edtions	)	suggested	that	rudolph	and	donner	were	simply	,	well	,	teammates	and	contemporaries	.	i	recall	,	as	well	,	having	some	ambivalence	about	the	hermey	subplot	.	yes	,	it	drove	home	the	misfit	theme	of	the	story	by	providing	rudolph	with	an	actual	friend	and	kindred	spirit	,	but	,	i	mean	,	c'mon	,	an	elf	who	wants	to	be	a	dentist	?	should	n't	they	just	be	magically	protected	from	something	as	mundane	as	tooth	decay	to	begin	with	?	but	like	most	60s	kids	,	i	was	still	kinda	taken	with	the	production	,	whatever	my	reservations	.	however	you	tell	it	,	the	rudolph	saga	is	a	classic	ugly	duckling	story	,	a	genre	just	about	every	kid	identifies	with	on	some	level	.	(	who	does	n't	feel	misunderstood	and	unappreciated	?	)	and	in	an	era	when	anti	bullying	messages	are	proliferating	(	and	,	i	sincerely	hope	,	are	being	heard	)	,	it	does	a	body	good	to	remember	one	such	classic	tale	from	an	earlier	era	.	some	kids	may	be	taken	aback	to	learn	that	,	in	this	version	,	even	santa	is	insensitive	(	and	,	oddly	enough	,	kinda	skinny	most	of	the	time	,	'til	mrs	.	claus	fattens	him	up	anyway	)	.	santa	's	initial	reaction	is	to	dismiss	rudolph	as	a	potential	drafts	reindeer	,	and	rather	summarily	at	that	.	but	even	in	the	original	song	,	come	to	think	of	it	,	there	's	no	indication	that	santa	's	interest	in	rudolph	is	anything	but	utilitarian	.	you	never	saw	him	scolding	the	other	reindeer	for	not	letting	poor	rudolph	join	in	any	reindeer	games	.	if	it	had	n't	been	for	that	foggy	christmas	eve	.	i	've	often	wondered	if	the	stop	motion	animation	of	this	version	of	rudolph	might	not	seem	too	primitive	and	awkward	for	the	current	crop	of	tykes	out	there	,	weaned	as	they	are	on	whizzbang	computer	generated	special	effects	.	well	,	a	few	years	ago	,	i	watched	the	dvd	with	my	niece	and	nephew	,	and	they	were	captivated	with	it	.	that	was	heartening	,	rudolph	is	a	warm	hearted	,	compassionate	tale	.	it	's	good	to	know	that	it	still	speaks	to	children	.	ps	oh	,	yeah	,	and	the	kids	get	to	discover	burl	ives'	songs	too	.	love	me	some	burl	ives	.
rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	is	an	enchanting	classic	narrated	by	burl	ives	that	kept	my	full	attention	as	a	child	and	is	still	wonderful	to	watch	.	rudolph	encounters	rejection	from	friends	and	family	and	runs	away	from	home	when	he	is	fortunate	to	meet	hermey	,	an	elf	who	longs	to	be	a	dentist	,	and	yukon	cornelius	,	a	gruff	miner	looking	for	gold	.	on	their	way	,	they	sail	to	the	island	of	misfit	toys	promising	to	let	santa	know	of	their	neglected	existence	.	after	a	horrible	storm	threatens	visibility	,	christmas	is	almost	canceled	until	santa	discovers	rudolph	's	shiny	nose	.	catchy	christmas	songs	and	animation	makes	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	a	wonderful	addition	to	anyone	's	movie	collection	!
hi	my	kids	5	,	3	,	1	years	old	saw	this	1	day	back	in	december	of	2011	.	we	bought	for	them	and	they	've	watched	it	at	least	a	dozen	or	so	times	since	.	they	love	this	movie	.	it	is	a	classic	and	it	was	obviously	ahead	of	its	time	.	highly	recommend	to	anyone	with	children	from	ages	1	36	)
christmas	just	would	n't	be	the	same	without	this	all	time	family	classic	.	while	the	stop	motion	animation	seems	just	a	wee	bit	antiquated	,	everything	else	about	quot	rudolph	quot	remains	timeless	.	the	eccentric	characters	such	as	herbie	the	elf	,	yukon	cornelius	and	the	abominable	snowman	are	unforgettable	.	the	journey	to	the	land	of	misfit	toys	toys	which	no	children	want	is	so	sadly	touching	.	the	soundtrack	,	filled	with	sing	a	long	classics	,	is	one	of	the	best	,	if	not	the	best	,	of	all	christmas	specials	.	best	of	all	is	the	grandfatherly	burl	ives	in	the	role	of	narrating	singing	snowman	.	congenial	and	witty	,	ives	is	the	perfect	host	for	this	perfect	holiday	special	.	overall	,	quot	rudolph	quot	endures	because	it	delivers	a	timeless	story	in	a	very	entertaining	manner	.	like	a	handful	of	holiday	classics	quot	charlie	brown	's	christmas	quot	and	the	animated	quot	grinch	quot	come	to	mind	quot	rudolph	quot	will	undoubtedly	entertain	children	for	decades	on	end	.	of	course	,	we	adults	know	that	quot	rudolph	quot	is	n't	for	kids	only	!	simply	unforgettable	.
the	mother	of	all	classic	kids	christmas	tales	,	and	this	series	just	moves	at	the	brisk	pace	of	santa	's	sleigh	on	xmas	eve	.	while	other	similar	shows	seem	to	have	parts	to	allow	time	to	run	errands	in	the	home	between	good	scenes	,	this	show	snaps	it	's	melodic	fingers	,	and	makes	you	drop	the	tablecloth	.	a	very	warm	,	engaging	,	and	wonderful	cast	with	songs	that	actually	hit	the	charts	by	other	famous	singers	,	make	this	one	and	only	of	it	's	kind	.	a	family	adventure	for	the	ages	,	and	then	some	.	burl	ives	makes	his	grand	entrance	ala	singing	snowman	,	and	ties	the	story	of	rudolph	's	troubles	all	together	.	one	more	thing	,	for	a	puppet	,	that	santa	is	pretty	darn	convincing	.	rudolph	's	friend	,	and	fellow	misfit	elf	herbie	,	is	also	a	unique	character	all	his	own	.	the	sets	are	nothing	short	of	dazzling	,	and	the	effects	just	add	to	the	atmosphere	,	without	distracting	or	looking	out	of	context	.	excellent	all	the	way	ho	,	ho	,	ho	!
i	bought	a	bunch	of	these	old	holiday	classics	on	dvd	recently	after	getting	tired	of	missing	their	tv	air	times	each	year	.	now	i	can	watch	them	all	anytime	i	want	,	i	love	it	!
when	a	televised	special	like	this	one	continues	to	capture	the	hearts	of	children	(	and	their	nostalgic	parents	)	year	after	year	since	1964	,	it	must	portray	an	aura	of	timelessness	in	order	to	have	such	a	long	shelf	life	.	well	,	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	does	exactly	that	by	using	the	misfits	theme	to	appeal	to	such	a	wide	audience	.	for	a	basic	plot	summary	,	rudolph	sees	the	young	reindeer	with	the	glowing	red	nosed	mocked	for	his	differences	and	unable	to	join	in	any	reindeer	games	.	without	any	chance	of	joining	santa	's	sleigh	team	,	rudolph	(	along	with	fellow	misfit	elf	herbie	,	who	wants	to	be	a	dentist	instead	of	making	toys	)	embarks	out	into	the	wilderness	himself	,	encountering	an	abominable	snow	monster	and	a	hearty	prospector	who	helps	him	survive	.	along	the	way	,	rudolph	and	herbie	find	themselves	on	the	island	of	misfit	toys	,	an	experience	that	encourages	both	of	them	to	return	home	.	because	every	child	(	whether	perceived	or	otherwise	)	goes	through	that	ugly	duckling	stage	in	life	,	the	themes	in	this	little	special	are	indeed	timeless	.	the	children	who	watched	it	originally	back	in	1964	and	the	following	years	grew	up	,	but	never	quite	outgrew	its	classic	holiday	themes	,	passing	it	on	to	their	own	children	until	it	now	has	become	a	holiday	tradition	.	what	also	helps	rudolph	stand	apart	from	the	rest	of	the	holiday	specials	is	its	claymation	format	.	there	is	probably	a	reason	why	claymation	is	no	longer	used	today	in	hollywood	on	this	sort	of	scale	,	but	that	rarity	only	enhances	this	show	's	appeal	.	overall	,	there	are	three	holiday	media	events	that	i	try	not	to	miss	each	december	it	's	a	wonderful	life	,	frosty	the	snowman	,	and	this	rudolph	.	i	can	watch	them	with	a	sibling	child	and	introduce	a	new	generation	to	the	old	traditions	,	or	i	can	watch	them	by	myself	and	rekindle	those	christmases	long	,	long	ago	.
wow	!	underdog	is	one	of	those	shows	that	does	n't	get	nearly	the	attention	it	deserves	.	it	's	been	decades	since	i	've	seen	or	heard	anything	about	the	show	.	as	such	,	i	was	surprised	at	all	the	little	gems	hidden	in	these	classic	shows	.	i	loved	seeing	things	like	simon	barsinister	the	meanest	man	in	the	world	,	creating	machines	to	help	him	rule	the	world	.	do	you	remember	some	of	them	?	like	his	machine	designed	to	shrink	everyone	in	the	world	to	6	inches	tall	?	with	my	new	shinking	gun	,	i	'll	be	the	tallest	man	in	the	world	!	it	was	great	re	living	those	great	memories	again	.
as	a	devoted	julia	child	fan	i	am	very	impressed	with	this	dvd	of	ms	.	julia	cooking	everything	!	the	dvd	is	very	user	friendly	,	easy	to	navigate	and	beautiful	in	it	's	simplicity	yet	astounding	in	the	amount	of	basic	cooking	techniques	demonstrated	!	there	are	nearly	60	recipes	on	each	of	the	discs	.	the	recipe	booklet	included	with	the	2	dvd	set	is	fantastic	.	seeing	each	recipe	come	together	step	by	step	live	and	in	living	color	is	extremely	helpful	along	with	knowing	what	the	end	result	is	supposed	to	look	like	!	i	can	only	wish	i	had	had	such	a	resource	when	i	was	a	novice	cook	over	40	yrs	ago	!	what	a	wonderful	gift	idea	for	a	bridal	shower	,	new	college	student	or	housewarming	for	a	newbie	starting	out	on	their	own	.	the	way	to	cook	dvdi	never	tire	of	listening	to	julia	's	distinctive	voice	and	watching	her	friendly	,	non	fru	fru	mannerisms	coupled	with	her	impeccable	class	as	a	lady	,	a	chef	and	an	instructor	.	once	again	dear	julia	bravo	,	bravo	,	bravo	indeed	!
i	have	always	loved	julia	child	and	have	learned	so	much	from	watching	her	shows	and	reading	her	cookbooks	.	this	series	for	the	cookbook	of	the	same	name	is	fair	but	it	looks	like	it	was	done	fast	and	34	on	the	cheap	.	34	i	wish	they	would	release	her	julia	child	and	company	series	.	i	really	loved	that	one	and	some	of	her	other	shows	.
wonderful	movie	and	a	must	see	!	i	watch	it	every	easter	as	a	reminder	of	what	the	holiday	and	my	faith	is	about	.
the	passion	of	the	christ	is	a	film	i	doubt	will	ever	be	shown	on	television	as	an	easter	holidays	special	.	it	interweaves	high	level	violence	worse	then	you	found	in	most	horror	films	,	the	subtitling	of	two	languages	,	and	the	brutal	simplistic	story	of	a	medieval	passion	play	.	there	is	a	single	theme	brought	home	again	and	again	.	christ	suffered	for	our	sins	.	when	mel	gibson	first	planned	making	the	film	,	he	did	n't	want	to	use	subtitles	.	through	most	of	the	film	,	you	do	n't	need	them	anyway	to	understand	what	is	taking	place	.	there	is	a	visual	language	in	the	stylised	costumes	,	and	the	acting	.	jesus	christ	(	james	caviezel	)	has	a	quiet	distance	from	the	world	that	shows	without	words	he	is	the	son	of	god	.	speaking	,	caviezel	detracts	from	this	by	delivering	his	lines	with	a	wooden	earnestness	.	the	film	occurs	during	the	last	twelve	hours	of	the	life	of	jesus	.	it	is	n't	easy	to	understand	the	story	.	gibson	may	think	his	audience	will	have	read	the	new	testament	.	or	he	did	n't	want	this	story	to	detract	from	the	violence	,	at	the	heart	of	the	film	.	this	violence	begins	when	he	is	taken	prisoner	by	the	jewish	temple	guards	.	to	describe	the	violence	he	suffered	here	would	be	to	detract	from	the	graphic	nature	of	it	.	reading	what	happens	to	him	,	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	suspend	your	disbelief	to	believe	he	could	have	survived	any	of	it	.	the	scourging	of	jesus	is	made	worse	by	gibson	's	attention	to	detail	.	the	romans	have	to	work	themselves	up	to	be	able	to	do	it	.	the	sound	made	by	the	torture	instruments	striking	into	jesus'	flesh	.	even	when	gibson	shies	away	from	the	scourging	,	you	can	still	hear	it	.	this	will	probably	become	one	of	the	most	memorable	,	and	horrifying	,	sequences	in	cinematic	history	.	between	the	scenes	of	jesus'	torment	,	we	witness	the	other	characters	in	the	story	.	judas	iscariot	(	luca	lionello	)	receives	his	30	pieces	of	silver	for	betraying	jesus	.	but	he	,	and	his	money	are	cursed	.	in	scenes	of	graphic	ugliness	,	he	is	driven	to	madness	and	suicide	.	the	two	marys	,	jesus'	mother	(	maia	morgenstern	)	and	the	former	prostitute	mary	magdalene	(	monica	bellucci	)	are	there	to	witness	,	and	react	to	the	suffering	of	jesus	.	it	is	from	them	,	we	are	meant	to	gauge	how	to	feel	about	the	events	unfolding	on	the	screen	.	these	events	are	of	suffering	and	pain	.	the	actual	crucifixion	is	almost	a	relief	after	the	scourging	.	by	then	jesus	is	a	half	dead	,	blood	splattered	ruin	of	a	man	.	he	dies	on	the	cross	along	side	two	common	criminals	.	to	keep	the	interest	of	his	audience	,	here	gibson	adds	hollywood	touches	you	wo	n't	find	in	any	bible	.	you	also	wo	n't	find	any	spirituality	,	or	goodness	here	.	the	theme	of	this	dark	movie	is	the	pain	and	suffering	jesus	suffered	on	behalf	of	christians	.	for	them	,	it	is	a	gorefest	held	in	a	good	cause	.	it	is	this	audience	the	film	is	intended	for	.
this	depiction	of	jesus'	last	hours	raises	eternal	questions	,	and	stirs	the	emotions	and	the	intellect	.	more	than	any	other	film	of	his	life	that	i	have	seen	.	gibson	's	direction	is	inspired	,	and	stays	very	close	to	new	testament	scripture	,	with	additional	elements	from	the	old	testament	.	there	are	so	many	exquisite	details	in	this	film	that	despite	its	brutality	,	give	it	the	beauty	inherent	in	all	great	works	of	art	.	i	could	write	at	least	1	,	000	words	about	this	film	,	but	will	simply	urge	everyone	(	except	children	)	to	see	it	.	it	is	very	violent	,	but	so	is	the	earth	we	walk	on	,	with	its	earthquakes	and	volcanos	,	and	continual	wars	since	the	dawn	of	man	.	i	think	perhaps	some	people	find	this	film	more	graphic	than	the	usual	senseless	savagery	that	assaults	the	senses	in	today	's	films	because	of	the	meaning	behind	the	scourging	and	crucifixion	it	is	very	disturbing	,	and	it	should	be	.	there	is	no	anti	semitism	,	any	more	than	there	would	be	anti	romanism	.	no	one	killed	jesus	,	he	laid	down	his	life	.	it	also	depicts	extremely	heroic	and	compassionate	jews	,	and	priests	who	are	angered	by	the	arrest	of	jesus	and	call	it	a	travesty	.	the	cast	is	superb	,	as	well	as	other	elements	like	cinematography	,	score	,	and	art	direction	,	but	this	is	gibson	's	masterpiece	,	a	magnificent	work	that	will	touch	millions	of	hearts	that	are	ready	to	hear	its	message	.	the	dvd	release	(	which	includes	no	extras	)	is	a	rather	dark	transfer	,	at	times	not	having	the	full	range	of	color	of	the	original	.	the	good	aspect	of	it	is	that	one	can	see	it	as	mr	.	gibson	originally	intended	his	film	to	be	seen	,	with	no	subtitles	.
finally	,	mel	gibson	's	controversial	movie	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	arrives	on	dvd	.	the	film	has	been	the	generator	of	an	impressive	publicity	campaign	magazines	,	tv	,	newspapers	,	religious	and	non	religious	comments	,	you	name	it	.	however	,	the	most	interesting	thing	about	it	is	that	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	is	not	your	typical	hollywood	biography	,	this	is	not	a	crowd	pleaser	,	the	film	is	a	risky	proposal	and	does	n't	make	concessions	at	all	.	director	mel	gibson	could	have	made	a	comfortable	film	,	with	well	known	superstars	such	as	himself	in	the	lead	roles	,	but	the	main	criterion	to	chose	the	actors	was	that	their	physical	appearance	and	acting	style	were	suitable	for	the	essence	of	each	role	.	basically	,	the	cast	is	a	bunch	of	little	known	actors	(	at	least	when	the	movie	was	filmed	)	jim	caviezel	as	jesus	,	the	gorgeous	monica	bellucci	as	mary	magdalene	,	rosalinda	celentano	as	satan	and	maia	morgenstern	as	mary	.	most	of	those	names	did	n't	say	too	much	before	the	release	of	the	movie	,	but	their	performances	are	solid	and	believable	.	in	the	technical	aspect	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	is	excellent	.	the	costumes	,	the	makeup	,	the	photography	,	the	sets	,	the	locations	are	amazing	,	you	really	get	the	sensation	that	you	are	a	witness	of	the	real	events	.	the	photography	shows	beautiful	landscapes	that	made	a	big	contrast	with	the	tragic	scenes	in	the	movie	,	a	very	interesting	combination	.	the	music	is	atmospheric	and	the	sound	effects	are	very	real	.	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	visually	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	movies	ever	made	because	there	are	a	lot	of	violent	scenes	,	most	of	them	are	so	real	that	you	can	almost	feel	the	pain	and	the	torture	,	definitely	this	is	not	a	movie	for	little	children	,	is	a	movie	for	mature	audiences	.	by	the	way	,	there	has	been	a	lot	of	criticism	for	mel	gibson	because	some	people	think	that	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	is	an	anti	semitic	movie	,	that	is	,	against	the	jewish	,	but	let	's	be	objective	here	,	the	message	is	very	clear	and	obvious	,	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	is	a	criticism	against	the	whole	human	race	,	not	against	a	specific	community	.	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	invites	everybody	to	reflect	about	our	violent	behavior	,	most	of	us	are	capable	of	using	violent	methods	in	order	to	get	our	own	benefit	.	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	invites	us	to	reflect	about	our	very	own	human	nature	.	definitely	,	mel	gibson	is	a	very	,	very	interesting	director	,	let	's	keep	an	eye	on	him	,	he	might	surprise	us	again	,	like	he	did	with	quot	braveheart	quot	and	with	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	.
.	to	me	mel	gibson	's	stunning	the	passion	of	the	christ	may	not	be	world	class	but	is	close	to	it	,	as	memorable	in	its	way	as	to	kill	a	mockingbird	,	an	american	in	paris	or	amarcord	and	worthy	of	such	enduring	acceptance	.	was	gibson	's	life	work	anti	semitic	?	in	my	opinion	,	no	.	blame	herod	,	who	is	at	all	times	righteous	,	unbending	,	fixated	on	jesus'	technical	violations	of	hebraic	codes	and	totally	hypocritical	when	viewed	against	his	son	's	sybaritic	,	romanized	and	decadent	lifestyle	truly	a	pharisee	!	but	the	film	's	plotwork	the	new	testament	book	of	mark	,	chapters	14	through	end	,	with	flashbacks	to	chapter	13	,	give	us	sufficient	motivation	to	the	herod	character	by	mentioning	his	envy	of	jesus	surely	that	envy	could	only	be	spiritual	and	not	material	or	political	,	except	political	by	indirection	?	the	other	two	synoptic	gospels	,	matthew	and	luke	,	enhance	the	motif	.	also	,	gibson	's	film	portrays	not	so	much	the	mob	,	the	crowd	,	the	jews	,	or	what	other	popular	english	language	bible	translations	have	calling	for	jesus'	crucifixion	after	barabbas'	release	rather	,	the	film	clearly	shows	pilate	offering	the	option	that	jesus	be	spared	or	executed	after	physical	chastisement	and	herod	himself	specifically	calling	for	his	crucifixion	and	then	,	the	heavy	majority	(	but	not	all	)	of	those	gathered	chiming	in	.	perhaps	the	film	can	be	gently	blamed	for	over	sympathizing	with	the	romans	,	but	the	pendulum	swung	both	ways	.	the	centurions	and	soldiers	charged	with	whipping	jesus	were	clearly	a	sadistic	lot	who	specialized	in	torture	and	crucifixion	,	ogre	like	in	appearance	,	with	heavy	broad	noses	and	dark	brown	eyes	.	(	they	both	looked	and	acted	subhuman	.	)	on	the	other	hand	,	and	i	think	gibson	is	using	italian	racial	sub	typing	to	his	advantage	,	the	common	soldiers	whose	task	it	was	to	accompany	christ	to	golgotha	,	while	keeping	away	the	locals	who	wanted	a	piece	of	him	,	had	more	clearly	piedmontese	features	,	aquiline	noses	and	hazel	eyes	.	an	excellent	eastern	bloc	actor	played	pontius	pilate	and	invested	the	character	with	a	great	deal	of	sympathy	by	means	of	close	acting	that	showed	the	dilemma	pilate	was	in	the	necessity	of	practical	politics	overriding	the	desirability	of	treating	jesus	in	a	more	humane	,	common	sense	manner	(	at	least	according	to	roman	ad	30	standards	)	.	in	one	of	the	few	additions	to	material	not	found	in	matthew	,	mark	or	luke	lydia	,	pilate	's	wife	,	brings	several	clean	white	linen	pieces	of	cloth	to	mary	and	mary	magdalene	.	we	,	the	largely	christian	audience	,	know	that	these	will	become	relics	.	was	the	passion	of	christ	violent	?	in	a	b	movie	sense	,	meaning	gratuitous	brawling	and	blood	letting	,	no	.	it	was	true	to	the	text	in	that	it	portrayed	the	last	12	hours	of	jesus'	life	in	a	graphic	,	literarily	ash	can	naturalistic	fashion	,	right	down	to	the	maggots	crawling	out	of	the	head	of	a	dead	donkey	within	judas'	vision	as	he	slumps	against	a	tree	in	terror	.

the	man	would	make	history	.	his	life	,	death	and	resurrection	would	rock	the	world	and	challenge	every	man	,	woman	and	child	for	generations	to	come	.	his	existence	had	been	foretold	since	the	beginning	of	time	.	he	would	save	the	world	from	their	sins	.	he	would	turn	aside	the	wrath	of	almighty	god	from	all	those	who	believed	in	his	name	and	lived	for	him	.	his	name	is	jesus	christ	.	today	,	he	's	alive	.	but	the	world	killed	him	when	he	came	because	it	did	not	know	him	.	mel	gibson	's	controversial	film	about	the	final	12	hours	of	the	life	of	jesus	of	nazareth	has	been	met	with	one	of	two	responses	extreme	love	or	extreme	hate	.	i	have	yet	to	meet	anyone	who	was	50	50	about	the	film	.	this	reviewer	loved	the	film	.	i	make	it	an	annual	event	to	watch	it	as	a	personal	reminder	of	what	jesus	christ	did	for	me	nearly	2000	years	ago	.	jim	caviezel	's	portrayal	of	jesus	of	nazareth	is	one	filled	with	love	,	serenity	and	,	yes	,	passion	.	you	can	see	the	love	of	jesus	for	all	people	in	his	eyes	when	he	speaks	.	you	can	see	the	hurt	when	he	is	treated	unjustly	.	if	jim	caviezel	did	so	awesome	a	job	portraying	jesus	,	one	can	only	imagine	the	lord	's	expression	when	the	events	in	this	film	actually	happened	a	couple	millennia	ago	.	based	on	the	gospels	and	roman	and	jewish	history	,	mel	gibson	has	crafted	a	well	executed	account	on	what	jesus	christ	went	through	on	our	behalf	.	many	complain	the	film	is	nothing	but	sheer	gore	.	yes	,	it	is	bloody	,	but	if	you	look	into	roman	history	and	discovered	what	roman	scourging	and	crucifixion	entailed	,	you	'd	find	gibson	's	film	is	bang	on	.	he	also	made	the	right	choice	to	display	what	happened	how	it	happened	instead	of	just	putting	a	few	scratch	marks	on	jesus	and	a	robe	splashed	with	red	paint	like	other	films	have	done	.	by	seeing	jesus	murdered	as	he	was	,	the	audience	feels	the	impact	of	that	day	long	ago	.	it	forces	them	to	pause	and	reflect	.	this	film	serves	as	a	reminder	for	believers	in	jesus	,	and	serves	,	hopefully	,	as	a	touching	account	of	the	ultimate	sacrifice	from	the	ultimate	love	to	those	who	do	n't	believe	.	it	would	take	a	terribly	cold	heart	to	not	be	moved	by	this	film	.	very	recommended	.	a	.	p	.	fuchs
ah	,	finally	!	another	review	by	me	!	how	bout	that	?	been	quite	a	long	time	since	i	've	written	a	review	for	amazon	.	com	,	and	finally	i	've	written	something	that	will	rock	with	your	head	and	eat	your	soul	like	my	others	.	here	's	a	review	i	've	put	off	writing	for	quite	awhile	because	i	really	wanted	to	wait	for	the	hype	to	die	down	.	and	after	reading	so	many	different	viewpoints	on	this	website	and	others	,	it	's	caused	quite	a	stir	indeed	.	well	,	here	we	go	.	the	film	largely	follows	that	of	the	catholic	faith	's	stations	of	the	cross	and	while	i'm	not	too	entirely	familiar	with	it	,	i	know	that	it	details	the	passion	(	literally	meaning	suffering	)	of	jesus	christ	and	finally	being	nailed	on	the	cross	.	mel	gibson	himself	is	catholic	and	had	this	idea	incubating	in	his	head	for	years	and	i	'll	tell	you	what	,	this	film	really	got	to	me	.	it	's	wondrous	cinematography	(	remember	the	film	the	black	stallion	?	same	guy	!	)	,	authentic	languages	of	aramaic	and	latin	(	which	by	the	way	,	aramaic	was	used	by	the	common	people	,	latin	by	the	romans	.	just	thought	you	'd	find	that	interesting	.	)	,	and	the	wonderful	performances	by	everyone	involved	,	especially	jim	caviezel	as	jesus	.	i	previously	saw	him	in	frequency	and	already	knew	he	was	a	good	actor	,	but	this	movie	proved	that	he	is	indeed	a	great	actor	.	monica	bellucci	,	who	played	in	the	matrix	films	and	played	a	whore	in	that	stupid	brotherhood	of	the	wolf	film	,	is	mary	magdalene	here	and	also	turns	in	a	fine	performance	here	.	gibson	actually	did	some	nice	artistic	touches	here	,	especially	with	the	flashbacks	.	i	think	this	is	where	some	christians	get	pissed	off	because	he	took	a	few	liberties	.	example	in	the	bible	when	jesus	is	tempted	in	the	garden	of	gethsemane	,	we	see	satan	(	presumably	)	tempting	him	to	not	fulfill	the	prophecy	.	while	the	bible	never	outright	says	it	is	satan	,	i	found	it	very	plausible	.	satan	is	regarded	as	the	evil	spirit	,	or	the	fallen	angel	,	who	tempts	us	through	sin	.	it	would	seem	very	likely	to	me	that	satan	would	n't	want	jesus	to	die	for	us	.	gibson	also	used	the	original	sin	idea	,	showing	satan	with	the	ugly	baby	,	and	also	with	judas	being	shameful	and	eventually	killing	himself	for	what	he	had	done	.	my	only	complaint	with	this	is	i	wanted	to	see	a	little	more	to	the	resurrection	than	we	saw	.	i	wanted	to	see	everyone	's	faces	when	they	would	see	jesus	alive	and	well	.	oh	well	,	i	guess	.	after	all	,	no	matter	how	well	you	make	a	religious	film	,	it	ca	n't	be	perfect	(	and	plus	,	that	was	n't	really	the	focus	of	this	film	)	.	so	why	did	it	affect	me	like	it	did	?	well	,	i	may	be	the	strong	religious	person	that	i	am	(	and	loves	heavy	metal	,	how	about	that	?	)	,	but	in	growing	up	in	the	protestant	faith	,	i	never	really	concentrated	on	jesus'	suffering	after	all	,	without	the	resurrection	,	it	would	've	been	a	moot	point	.	however	,	when	watching	the	film	,	all	i	could	really	think	of	was	he	did	that	for	me	?	i	never	really	thought	about	what	he	went	through	,	and	this	film	changed	my	thinking	forever	.	i'm	not	sure	if	i	would	outright	tell	you	to	see	this	movie	because	it	's	very	graphic	and	poignant	however	,	if	you	do	,	i	highly	suggest	you	watch	it	with	an	open	mind	because	i	've	known	people	to	hate	it	just	because	of	their	opinions	on	what	the	bible	is	and	so	forth	.	if	you	do	n't	like	the	film	because	of	its	graphic	nature	,	then	you	are	well	in	your	right	.	if	you	do	n't	like	it	based	on	your	preconceptions	of	what	jesus	went	through	or	it	disagrees	with	your	religious	opinion	(	for	example	,	i	have	a	friend	who	did	n't	like	it	just	because	he	thought	jesus	was	totally	human	and	not	spiritually	the	son	of	god	and	therefore	could	not	live	during	the	crucifixion	.	)	,	then	that	is	simply	your	opinion	but	i	still	ca	n't	help	but	feel	like	you	are	allowing	those	preconceptions	to	override	the	fact	that	this	is	indeed	just	a	film	,	and	the	filmmaker	is	showing	his	deepest	love	for	christ	.	it	's	not	a	film	for	everybody	to	enjoy	and	even	i	find	it	hard	to	enjoy	as	entertainment	.	but	it	quite	possibly	might	have	been	the	most	influential	film	i	've	ever	seen	in	my	life	.	while	my	faith	first	and	foremost	comes	from	the	scriptures	,	this	film	still	makes	a	profound	impact	for	me	and	you	have	to	respect	mel	gibson	for	doing	what	he	did	.
a	few	observations	(	without	spoilers	)	i	finally	saw	this	movie	when	it	was	released	on	home	video	.	i	went	twice	to	watch	it	in	theaters	and	was	appalled	by	the	audience	awaiting	admittance	.	the	first	time	,	i	was	walking	from	the	parking	lot	to	the	box	office	when	a	small	bus	pulled	up	and	a	church	sunday	school	group	that	included	roughly	a	dozen	small	children	(	ages	5	to	maybe	8	roughly	)	hopped	out	with	chaperones	.	i	got	in	line	behind	them	and	listened	to	the	adults	talking	about	the	number	of	times	they	had	each	seen	the	film	and	how	much	they	were	looking	forward	to	discussing	it	with	the	children	afterwards	.	having	been	previously	advised	from	numerous	places	of	the	realism	of	the	torture	sequences	and	crucifixion	,	i	decided	the	greater	horror	for	me	would	be	in	seeing	these	small	children	react	to	the	supposedly	graphic	violence	.	i	simply	walked	back	to	my	car	and	went	home	.	the	second	time	(	a	few	weeks	later	after	the	initial	rush	of	people	going	to	a	new	movie	had	died	down	a	bit	)	i	actually	managed	to	purchase	a	ticket	and	was	waiting	in	the	lobby	for	the	previous	screening	to	let	out	.	a	few	minutes	later	,	the	doors	opened	and	the	crowd	began	shuffling	out	.	once	again	there	were	several	families	with	small	children	.	while	the	parents	attempted	to	masquerade	their	emotional	reactions	by	blinking	and	talking	about	how	the	sudden	bright	sunlight	was	tearing	them	up	,	the	children	were	n't	old	enough	to	be	embarrassed	about	showing	feelings	in	public	.	most	were	openly	sobbing	,	all	had	red	eyes	,	and	one	small	girl	(	perhaps	4	or	5	years	old	at	most	)	was	shaking	so	badly	that	her	dad	had	to	pick	her	up	,	console	her	,	and	carry	her	outside	.	once	again	,	i	was	so	upset	and	angry	i	had	to	leave	.	now	that	i	've	seen	it	with	my	own	eyes	i	can	see	why	those	kids	were	so	freaked	out	.	although	i	do	n't	belong	to	one	of	the	most	commonly	known	denominations	,	i	am	a	christian	.	i	am	also	a	daily	reader	of	the	scriptures	,	and	have	lectured	on	biblical	scripture	and	prophecy	all	over	the	eastern	u	.	s	.	in	churches	and	seminaries	,	as	well	as	on	college	campuses	.	in	other	words	,	while	i	would	n't	define	myself	as	an	expert	on	all	things	god	,	i'm	a	bit	more	spiritually	seasoned	than	most	laypeople	.	the	life	of	jesus	christ	,	as	depicted	in	the	bible	,	is	centered	around	the	final	3	years	of	his	earthly	life	.	his	birth	is	depicted	especially	in	regards	to	the	fulfillment	of	the	old	testament	prophecies	and	jewish	traditions	and	there	is	a	brief	mention	of	his	youth	in	the	book	of	luke	.	there	are	literally	dozens	of	events	during	the	3	years	of	christ	's	earthly	mission	that	are	filmworthy	.	in	fact	,	the	sheer	number	of	films	made	about	his	life	stand	as	proof	of	that	fact	.	did	the	world	truly	need	a	story	that	not	only	focuses	primarily	on	jesus'	final	week	,	but	uses	every	means	of	modern	effects	to	splatter	gore	and	depict	the	massive	agony	endured	by	the	son	of	god	?	maybe	i'm	in	the	minority	(	apparently	,	i	should	say	)	but	i	do	n't	need	to	watch	jesus	writhe	and	scream	with	each	strike	of	the	lash	in	order	to	respect	and	understand	the	sacrifice	such	suffering	represented	.	i	did	n't	need	to	personally	witness	the	nails	being	driven	in	,	the	biblical	depiction	sufficed	.	the	glory	of	christ	's	sacrifice	is	not	found	in	his	willingness	to	endure	pain	and	death	in	god	's	name	.	literally	hundreds	of	millions	of	ordinary	people	have	done	that	before	christ	's	birth	as	well	as	after	.	the	glory	of	christ	is	found	in	the	word	of	god	that	came	from	his	lips	and	the	power	of	the	holy	spirit	that	transformed	the	entirety	of	humankind	.	we	are	asked	to	live	the	message	and	believe	in	christ	's	name	.	we	are	not	required	to	bear	witness	to	the	atrocities	committed	to	his	human	vessel	.	but	most	important	of	all	,	i	deeply	believe	that	forcing	or	allowing	small	children	to	endure	the	trauma	of	watching	the	torture	and	murder	of	someone	they	have	been	taught	to	love	above	all	others	is	not	only	unnecessary	,	but	borders	on	abuse	.	learning	of	the	passion	from	the	bible	or	from	suitable	talks	with	parents	,	clergy	,	and	sunday	school	teachers	should	be	enough	education	for	a	small	child	to	understand	that	god	loves	them	and	that	jesus	can	live	within	their	hearts	.	mel	gibson	may	have	had	the	best	intentions	(	my	right	to	judge	ends	at	the	tip	of	my	own	nose	)	but	i	am	of	the	opinion	that	the	end	result	represents	a	massive	and	grotesque	misjudgement	.	feel	free	to	slam	this	review	if	that	is	your	wont	.	but	please	take	a	moment	to	consider	whether	this	film	is	age	appropriate	to	your	own	children	as	well	.	thank	you	for	your	time	.
i	went	to	see	what	all	the	hype	was	about	.	i	came	away	with	a	mixed	impression	.	it	was	hard	to	follow	at	times	and	very	hard	to	watch	the	violence	.	but	i	can	see	how	some	might	think	it	a	great	movie	.

mel	gibson	is	an	ok	actor	but	his	real	talent	is	directing	and	movies	like	the	passion	of	christ	or	apocalypto	prove	it	.	braveheart	was	quite	good	,	too	,	but	he	's	outdone	himself	with	the	passion	of	christ	.	first	of	all	,	using	aramaic	instead	of	english	thank	you	!	brilliant	and	brave	idea	!	secondly	,	casting	jim	caviezel	as	jesus	,	stroke	of	a	genius	,	this	actor	is	absolutely	believable	in	his	role	.	and	finally	not	shunning	away	from	excessive	and	prolonged	violence	.	think	what	you	will	of	onscreen	violence	,	but	in	this	film	it	's	a	must	.	christ	's	suffering	and	his	sacrifice	do	not	come	across	as	well	without	these	violent	scenes	,	which	is	why	other	movies	about	the	crucifixion	are	not	as	powerful	as	gibson	's	film	.	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	definitely	not	for	children	and	without	the	religious	context	this	would	have	most	definitely	been	an	nc	17	.
it	was	well	made	,	and	the	actors	were	superb	.	it	is	unforgeable	and	the	music	was	compeling	.	i	vote	the	best	picture	of	the	year	,	with	the	best	actors	and	most	importantly	the	topic	was	a	reality	check	.
so	many	well	meaning	christians	have	found	something	to	like	about	this	film	that	i	,	a	lifelong	film	buff	but	also	a	christian	,	hesitate	to	express	my	views	.	alas	,	i	find	little	about	this	film	that	is	likeable	or	meritable	.	first	,	the	makeup	and	prosthetics	were	lamentably	bad	!	the	film	had	the	feel	of	a	concoction	.	for	me	,	it	lacked	depth	,	gravity	,	artistic	impact	,	rather	like	watching	someone	paint	by	numbers	,	or	else	place	ingredients	into	a	jar	and	shake	them	up	,	hoping	they	will	come	out	arranged	in	some	artistically	rewarding	order	.	where	was	the	inspiration	?	the	one	scene	i	liked	and	i	liked	it	very	much	was	when	jesus	was	at	home	and	working	as	a	carpenter	.	it	boded	so	well	.	alternatives	?	'jesus'	starring	brian	deacon	,	or	even	the	silent	'king	of	kings'	neither	of	which	is	unimpeachable	,	but	both	of	which	are	preferable	.
i	decided	to	give	this	film	3	stars	,	exactly	in	the	middle	of	the	rating	system	,	because	there	were	scenes	of	great	beauty	and	insight	and	then	there	were	scenes	of	torture	that	were	excessive	and	made	me	question	the	motives	of	the	film	makers	.	after	reading	many	of	the	reviews	of	this	film	,	i	am	reflecting	on	the	conception	of	the	atonement	in	christianity	and	whether	this	film	supported	or	undermined	that	basic	theme	that	undergirds	christian	belief	.	the	atonement	is	a	process	whereby	a	perfect	sacrifice	is	made	to	god	the	father	for	the	sins	of	mankind	.	since	there	is	no	perfection	except	in	god	,	then	god	himself	must	be	sacrificed	,	and	this	is	done	through	the	death	of	his	beloved	son	,	jesus	christ	,	who	is	one	with	the	father	and	the	holy	ghost	.	thus	mankind	's	sins	would	remain	upon	us	unless	this	perfect	atonement	is	made	,	offering	the	possibility	of	life	everlasting	in	heaven	with	god	.	so	the	question	arises	,	is	all	this	torture	necessary	for	the	atonement	to	occur	?	must	christ	have	experienced	this	incredible	gory	and	terrible	torture	to	take	the	sins	of	the	whole	world	upon	him	?	as	the	sacrificial	lamb	,	must	he	endure	considerable	pain	and	loss	of	blood	,	to	take	the	sins	of	the	world	on	his	shoulders	?	i	think	not	.	it	is	the	death	of	the	innocent	lamb	that	is	the	sacrifice	and	atonement	for	the	sins	of	the	whole	world	,	not	the	endurance	of	the	considerable	bloody	torture	that	leads	to	the	atonement	.	it	is	the	giving	of	his	life	,	a	pure	,	perfect	,	sacrifice	that	is	the	atonement	for	all	of	mankind	's	sins	.	so	this	leads	to	the	question	of	why	so	much	blood	and	gore	?	was	gibson	trying	to	say	that	mankind	is	so	terrible	that	we	do	not	deserve	the	sacrifice	and	atonement	?	well	there	is	no	question	there	for	surely	we	know	mankind	not	to	be	deserving	of	complete	and	perfect	grace	upon	our	own	merits	,	either	as	a	species	or	individually	.	was	there	some	commentary	about	the	religious	and	political	establishment	being	made	by	the	torture	scenes	?	well	,	it	was	organized	religion	and	organized	political	oppression	that	together	brought	about	the	torture	and	death	,	to	be	sure	,	but	is	gibson	trying	to	say	that	organized	religion	in	partnership	with	an	oppressive	central	government	is	capable	of	great	cruelty	to	the	innocent	,	even	unto	god	in	a	human	state	of	existence	?	i	never	got	the	impression	that	the	meaning	of	the	film	and	sequence	of	scenes	was	really	strategically	thought	through	and	thus	in	some	ways	this	is	only	a	terribly	vicious	,	painful	,	gory	snuff	film	with	little	reflection	on	the	meaning	of	the	sacrifice	and	atonement	which	are	central	concepts	in	christianity	and	far	more	important	than	the	nasty	beating	scenes	where	the	flesh	is	literally	pulled	off	the	back	and	ribs	of	christ	.	does	a	sensationalistic	portrayal	of	the	passion	of	christ	do	a	service	or	disservice	to	christianity	?	it	really	does	neither	for	the	movement	of	the	christ	goes	far	beyond	our	ability	to	conceptualize	the	vast	mystery	of	why	atonement	is	necessary	and	why	god	himself	,	in	the	human	form	of	jesus	,	must	make	that	sacrifice	.	for	muddled	thought	and	purpose	,	this	film	only	gets	3	stars	.
first	i	would	like	to	say	thank	you	to	mel	gibson	.	you	have	delivered	the	most	powerful	movie	that	i	have	ever	seen	.	even	with	all	of	the	controversy	,	you	have	stood	by	your	film	and	i	salute	your	commitment	and	passion	for	your	work	and	your	faith	.	this	is	an	amazing	movie	.	yes	,	there	are	very	many	appalling	scenes	of	jesus	being	beaten	and	crucified	.	this	movie	made	me	tear	up	in	many	parts	,	especially	when	jesus	saw	his	mother	mary	and	gained	strength	,	after	a	brutal	lashing	,	to	continue	carrying	his	cross	to	his	eventual	death	.	this	movie	really	made	me	realize	one	thing	.	any	time	that	i	feel	as	though	i	am	sacrificing	alot	,	i	will	think	back	on	the	punishment	jesus	recieved	for	our	sins	and	realize	how	ridiculous	i	am	.
up	to	this	point	,	i	considered	1993	's	schindler	's	list	the	ultimate	in	cinematic	emotional	drain	.	but	the	passion	of	the	christ	stirs	even	more	emotions	,	the	most	salient	of	which	are	anger	,	shock	,	and	melancholy	.	by	tapping	into	the	primary	art	medium	of	our	time	,	the	darkest	slice	of	christ	's	biography	,	his	torture	and	execution	at	the	hands	of	jewish	clergy	and	roman	authority	,	has	once	again	asserted	itself	as	the	most	influential	story	ever	told	.	opening	in	a	gethsemane	bathed	in	blue	light	,	director	mel	gibson	quickly	introduces	one	of	his	innovations	,	an	androgynous	and	druidic	satan	figure	who	will	flit	through	the	rest	of	the	narrative	,	appearing	even	on	the	via	dolorosa	carrying	some	sort	of	mutant	child	.	overall	,	however	,	the	film	is	faithful	,	perhaps	even	excessively	faithful	,	to	the	canonical	gospel	accounts	of	christ	's	last	hours	.	it	strives	for	realism	enough	to	allow	its	characters	to	speak	latin	and	aramaic	,	revealing	jesus'	name	as	yehosua	,	but	it	presents	the	miraculous	as	well	christ	restoring	a	man	's	sliced	ear	or	the	temple	cracking	in	half	as	the	moment	of	christ	's	death	.	most	significantly	,	it	presents	the	resurrection	of	christ	in	a	brief	and	artful	scene	in	which	he	disappears	from	his	tunic	,	which	fluffs	and	falls	,	reconstituting	himself	as	unblemished	except	for	the	holes	of	his	stigmata	.	but	jesus	is	hardly	unblemished	through	most	of	the	film	.	unless	you	've	moved	into	the	rathole	vacated	by	saddam	hussein	,	you	're	aware	that	this	2004	film	offers	the	most	graphic	presentation	of	jesus'	suffering	in	any	christ	film	yet	.	his	torturers	are	far	more	sadistic	than	in	king	of	kings	or	jesus	of	nazareth	.	the	scene	of	christ	's	scourging	has	quickly	become	a	conversation	piece	as	the	movie	rules	the	box	office	.	most	of	the	romans	who	administer	the	scourging	are	vicious	thugs	who	seem	to	relish	the	destruction	of	a	body	.	choosing	a	whip	whose	hooks	tear	flesh	from	bone	,	they	render	jesus	a	bloody	pulp	from	head	to	toe	,	exposing	spongy	subdermal	layers	and	even	a	few	ribs	.	by	the	time	the	actual	crucifixion	occurs	,	we	see	an	elbow	bone	poking	through	skin	as	well	.	the	first	nail	is	driven	in	with	a	geyser	of	blood	.	this	is	not	,	however	,	gratuitous	violence	.	the	suffering	here	is	the	point	.	it	is	a	statement	and	a	sacrifice	in	the	mind	of	the	one	suffering	and	his	two	billion	believers	.	actually	,	mel	gibson	pulls	his	punches	in	a	few	places	,	since	crucifixion	involved	asphyxiation	and	baking	in	the	sun	,	neither	of	which	isdepicted	in	the	passion	.	the	acting	and	direction	are	solid	,	even	excellent	in	the	passion	the	christ	,	but	the	real	star	here	is	an	ace	cinematographer	.	certain	visuals	are	seared	on	your	brain	after	seeing	the	passion	.	these	include	the	unctuous	eyebrow	less	devil	with	his	mutant	baby	,	the	scenes	of	the	two	marys	taking	linen	and	mopping	what	looks	like	gallons	of	jesus'	blood	from	around	the	scourging	post	,	and	the	scene	which	finally	brought	tears	as	she	watches	her	son	fall	with	his	cross	,	mary	remembers	him	falling	as	a	little	boy	.	maternal	concern	written	all	over	her	face	,	she	runs	to	pick	him	up	.	but	30	years	later	as	she	approaches	her	son	,	she	is	unable	to	aid	him	,	only	watch	the	gruesome	spectacle	.	his	hair	stringy	,	his	face	covered	in	blood	and	sweat	,	he	assures	her	see	!	i	make	everything	new	!	was	anyone	ever	so	misunderstood	as	christ	?	so	many	in	the	film	from	pilate	to	caiaphas	just	do	n't	comprehend	that	christ	does	n't	seek	power	in	the	material	world	but	would	rather	direct	our	eyes	to	a	simmering	mirage	on	a	distant	dune	,	the	lifeforce	around	and	within	us	,	the	everlasting	spirit	that	will	survive	our	bodies	whose	oxygen	addiction	will	prove	fatal	in	80	years	.	mutiple	and	brief	flashbacks	to	the	sermon	on	the	mount	and	the	last	supper	feature	a	robust	charismatic	jesus	,	but	perhaps	these	are	too	brief	and	too	few	as	some	have	complained	.	they	might	have	been	increased	and	lengthened	to	create	a	more	effective	counterpoint	to	the	story	's	endless	gore	.	still	,	even	this	complaint	may	arise	from	discomfort	with	massive	human	suffering	.	does	n't	a	person	with	advanced	hiv	symptoms	suffer	like	this	?	how	about	a	person	standing	near	a	palestinian	suicide	bomber	or	withering	in	a	serbian	death	camp	?	this	kind	of	agony	and	destruction	is	still	all	around	us	,	so	jesus'	ability	to	find	meaning	in	it	will	not	lose	its	power	to	amaze	or	its	staggering	value	anytime	real	soon	.
this	is	a	film	about	subjects	most	people	would	rather	avoid	.	death	religion	do	n't	lend	themselves	to	rational	discussion	.	mel	gibson	haterswill	see	this	as	proof	of	his	insanity	intolerance	.	christians	will	see	too	much	violence	to	be	on	a	big	screen	.	humanists	will	see	the	shining	truth	that	christians	are	gullible	fools	willingly	self	deceived	,	but	what	about	the	movie	making	?	the	events	that	are	being	depicted	here	are	detailed	fairly	well	in	the	bible	.	does	the	movie	stay	close	to	it	's	literary	source	as	far	as	events	beatings	death	?	i	say	yes	it	does	.	someone	somewhere	should	get	credit	for	putting	that	on	the	screen	.	your	sense	of	appropriate	levels	of	violence	really	took	a	beating	in	this	story	as	it	's	told	in	the	bible	.	go	complain	there	.	the	movie	is	a	good	pictorial	representation	of	the	subject	matter	it	claims	to	cover	which	is	,	the	suffering	death	of	a	man	known	as	jesus	christ	as	revealed	in	a	book	about	his	life	.	you	can	claim	that	jesus	never	existed	.	you	can	claim	that	these	events	never	happened	.	you	can	claim	all	kinds	of	personal	preferences	but	you	ca	n't	claim	that	this	is	a	bad	movie	because	it	did	n't	stay	close	to	its	literary	source	.	you	ca	n't	claim	that	it	deliberately	embellished	that	story	.	mel	gibson	certainly	did	n't	create	the	story	since	it	was	n't	intended	to	meet	any	other	muster	than	its	relationship	to	it	's	source	i	feel	it	must	be	highly	rated	as	a	movie	movie	making	.	are	you	offended	by	the	show	for	some	reason	?	the	show	does	n't	care	.	it	was	n't	made	to	not	offend	.	to	belittle	what	was	done	on	screen	here	is	to	belittle	every	movie	that	ever	stayed	close	to	its	literary	source	.	i	understand	that	people	will	have	deep	feelings	because	of	their	personal	beliefs	but	it	's	really	sad	to	see	a	movie	bring	out	the	sentiments	of	'all	opposition	is	based	in	stupidity	or	illogical	beliefs'	no	discussion	of	the	movie	or	it	's	crafting	.	the	violence	is	deep	,	gritty	horrifying	but	the	subject	requires	it	from	the	source	.	this	is	5	star	cinema	it	's	not	for	everyone	.	especially	not	young	unformed	personalities	.	you	know	,	you	can	discuss	death	,	even	murder	,	with	a	little	child	but	it	has	to	be	within	his	speech	comprehension	level	.	you	can	show	him	pictures	of	death	murder	that	far	exceed	their	speech	comprehension	levels	these	images	most	assuredly	exceed	what	children	can	comprehend	.	i	'd	just	like	to	see	more	individual	evaluations	.	one	's	not	based	on	the	doctrines	of	a	group	,	be	it	religious	groups	or	any	others	.
whenever	i	think	about	what	our	lord	suffered	,	i	remember	why	i	am	a	christian	.	mel	gibson	did	an	excellent	job	of	portraying	what	our	lord	suffered	for	us	.	i	dont	think	people	realize	all	he	went	through	.	although	some	of	it	is	dramatization	of	perhaps	tradition	.	our	lord	did	suffer	this	and	more	.	the	passion	of	christ	should	be	our	passion	.
purely	from	the	point	of	view	of	watching	the	movie	it	was	amazing	.	the	film	costs	here	were	amazingly	well	spent	(	thats	what	the	stars	are	for	)	.	to	film	a	movie	in	latin	and	aramaic	was	brilliant	and	the	sets	and	costumes	were	amazing	.	i	think	they	could	have	saved	about	half	the	movie	budget	by	having	jesus	expend	a	human	amount	of	blood	but	that	's	ok	i	realize	it	was	necessary	for	gibson	to	stay	true	to	his	fundamentalist	catholic	views	and	strictly	follow	the	stations	of	the	cross	in	depicting	the	passion	of	christ	,	even	though	there	is	no	scriptural	evidence	for	them	.	having	said	this	though	it	is	important	to	point	out	what	a	horrible	theology	this	movie	presents	.	it	is	essentially	the	anselmian	view	that	jesus	was	incarnated	as	the	only	sufficient	sacrifice	for	our	sins	.	as	this	movie	presents	it	the	only	significant	part	of	jesus	's	life	is	his	death	.	it	is	this	sort	of	blood	soaked	religious	ideology	that	says	it	is	ok	to	kill	people	as	a	means	of	purification	.	even	as	an	atheist	i	can	see	that	this	is	probably	the	most	immoral	of	all	ethical	or	religious	doctrines	.	if	you	want	a	sound	theology	try	abelard	or	some	of	the	franciscan	authors	.	in	their	writings	the	incarnation	is	the	culmination	of	creation	,	an	event	that	was	planned	from	the	beginning	and	not	simply	a	reaction	to	people	behaving	badly	.	it	represents	the	ultimate	unification	of	god	with	his	creation	.	the	moral	lesson	comes	not	from	the	death	of	jesus	saving	us	from	our	sins	.	(	which	mires	human	beings	in	eternal	stupidity	and	does	n't	apparently	cure	us	of	sinfulness	either	.	so	it	is	pretty	much	a	wash	)	the	moral	message	needs	to	come	from	jesus	's	life	.	take	care	of	lepers	,	eat	with	tax	collectors	,	help	a	prostitute	get	on	her	feet	.	things	get	a	little	messed	up	but	its	not	anything	that	cannot	be	fixed	by	simply	doing	human	things	.
after	reading	the	(	majority	)	of	glowing	reviews	here	,	and	read	,	and	heard	the	hype	,	i	was	needless	to	say	expecting	an	experience	when	i	finally	saw	this	movie	(	.	)	.	i	did	get	one	,	but	not	as	i	hoped	.	for	me	,	the	only	things	that	made	the	movie	not	quite	as	powerful	and	moving	as	it	could	have	been	,	allthough	do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	it	certainley	was	those	two	things	and	many	more	,	was	as	follows	.	for	one	,	i	felt	that	some	of	the	subttitles	used	too	modern	words	such	as	'he	's	crazy'	for	example	,	i	felt	that	detracted	from	the	realism	,	because	2000	or	so	years	ago	surel	ey	words	like	that	would	not	have	existed	,	but	using	'dead'	languages	though	was	a	masterstroke	.	being	picky	,	i	know	but	,	allthough	jim	cavieziel	gave	an	amazing	performance	as	christ	,	i	just	expected	him	to	have	a	more	'holy'	aura	about	him	,	but	on	the	other	hand	,	maybe	the	message	that	christ	was	a	man	suffering	was	the	explanation	for	that	.	finally	,	i	think	that	the	rest	of	the	cast	were	all	excellent	,	but	just	needed	more	time	to	show	interaction	in	more	flashbacks	just	to	really	tug	at	your	heartstrings	even	more	,	maybe	.	those	small	criticisms	aside	,	i	am	really	glad	i	saw	this	powerful	,	gutwrenching	movie	,	and	we	will	want	too	see	it	again	defentiley	.	then	2nd	time	i	might	give	5	stars	.	the	score	is	good	,	cinematography	sometimes	beautiful	but	nevertheless	still	bloody	and	shocking	.	before	i	say	this	,	remember	that	i	am	not	practising	any	religon	,	so	cannot	comment	on	the	film	's	accuracy	,	but	i	think	i	can	sort	of	see	what	mr	.	gibson	is	trying	to	do	here	.	the	film	going	public	are	mainly	the'pulp	fiction'	generation	,	violence	in	films	has	to	be	really	bad	if	you	are	too	get	these	desensitized	minds	to	take	notice	of	a	serious	point	on	celluloid	you	are	trying	to	get	across	!	i	felt	there	was	a	sense	of	anger	in	this	film	,	sort	of'look	this	is	how	he	suffered	,	take	notice	,	even	if	i	have	too	show	you	this	horror'kind	of	statement	,	and	i	can	see	really	where	he	is	going	,	if	,	of	course	if	i	have	perceived	this	correctly	.	but	that	means	nothing	too	some	,	but	the	fact	that	i	even	felt	the	need	to	sit	here	and	write	this	says	something	about	the	movie	.	see	it	.	think	.	decide	for	yourself	.
i'm	sitting	here	a	day	after	having	viewed	the	movie	,	and	i'm	still	trying	to	decide	how	best	to	describe	it	.	how	am	i	supposed	to	fit	into	a	puny	1	,	000	words	or	less	how	powerful	and	amazing	this	film	is	?	i	ca	n't	.	it	's	amazing	.	i	'll	have	to	admit	(	at	the	cost	of	my	pride	)	that	this	film	even	caused	a	few	tears	to	stream	down	my	cheeks	.	something	i'm	typically	determined	not	to	have	happen	.	i	've	never	cried	for	any	other	movie	,	but	the	utter	determination	,	the	love	that	bound	my	savior	to	the	cross	was	mind	numbing	.	yes	,	it	's	violent	.	frankly	,	it	's	landmark	for	me	,	being	the	very	first	r	rated	film	i	've	ever	viewed	in	my	life	.	but	it	was	worth	it	,	i	have	no	regrets	.	and	although	you	would	know	the	best	whether	or	not	you	have	the	intestinal	fortitude	to	watch	this	,	let	me	just	offer	you	a	few	of	my	own	reasons	why	i	think	you	should	.	jesus	took	this	punishment	for	us	.	you	should	have	been	bound	to	that	whipping	block	.	i	should	have	.	each	and	every	one	of	us	has	sinned	against	god	,	and	deserves	no	less	than	the	most	painful	and	brutal	death	man	can	devise	,	with	eternal	suffering	and	condemnation	to	follow	.	we	deserve	that	.	by	god	's	good	grace	,	we	are	no	longer	bound	to	that	doom	.	if	our	savior	had	what	it	takes	to	endure	that	,	to	rescue	us	from	that	end	,	it	would	almost	seem	to	me	as	if	we	at	least	owe	him	to	look	squarely	in	the	face	that	which	he	endured	for	us	.	i	've	been	a	christian	all	of	my	life	,	and	generally	,	i'm	guessing	it	is	the	case	that	most	people	accept	the	fact	that	christ	died	for	us	,	and	we	move	on	.	which	is	good	,	of	course	,	do	n't	get	me	wrong	.	if	we	all	sat	around	agape	at	god	's	grace	,	we	'd	never	get	any	of	heaven	's	tasks	done	.	but	i	think	the	movie	changes	that	acceptance	.	it	forces	us	to	go	back	and	contemplate	exactly	how	difficult	of	a	concept	god	's	grace	truly	is	for	our	mortal	minds	to	attempt	to	fathom	.	it	makes	us	marvel	anew	.	throughout	the	film	,	i	kept	thinking	he	bore	all	that	for	me	.	for	me	!	yes	,	it	's	bloody	.	if	you	do	n't	think	you	can	watch	the	film	without	emblazoning	disturbing	images	on	your	mind	for	life	,	then	you	probably	should	n't	.	jesus	died	that	death	specifically	so	that	we	need	n't	suffer	it	.	but	i	can	attest	to	the	fact	that	i	do	n't	think	i	'll	ever	picture	christ	's	death	the	same	way	again	.	to	answer	the	old	song	's	question	were	you	there	when	they	crucified	my	lord	?	,	this	movie	will	make	you	feel	as	if	you	were	.	about	those	pesky	anti	semitic	charges	.	i'm	reminded	of	the	story	of	daniel	of	the	old	testament	,	wherein	daniel	's	enemies	were	searching	for	a	crime	to	charge	daniel	with	,	but	could	find	none	,	so	they	invented	one	.	besides	the	violence	,	anti	semitism	is	about	the	only	criticism	one	can	find	,	and	that	only	because	of	the	hype	.	(	and	we	all	know	how	concerned	hollywood	is	about	violence	!	)	in	truth	,	the	allegation	is	preposterous	.	this	film	is	history	,	dramatized	.	it	is	not	responsible	for	stirring	up	hateful	feelings	any	more	than	the	alamo	stirs	up	hatred	towards	mexicans	,	or	pearl	harbor	against	the	japanese	.	so	why	does	this	charge	still	supposedly	remain	an	issue	?	the	fact	is	,	if	you	enter	this	film	with	the	predetermined	mindset	that	this	film	will	contain	anti	semitic	material	,	you	know	what	?	you	could	very	well	see	some	.	i	attempted	to	find	some	,	and	you	know	what	?	one	can	if	you	entertain	the	presuppostion	,	then	you	'll	find	it	.	because	there	's	no	doubt	the	jewish	leaders	were	one	of	the	two	primary	bodies	responsible	for	the	death	of	jesus	.	but	the	romans	share	the	guilt	heavily	.	they	heartlessly	scourge	jesus	,	beat	him	,	mock	him	.	it	was	a	combined	effort	.	but	basically	,	the	point	is	this	.	if	you	exit	this	movie	with	anti	semitic	tendencies	in	your	heart	,	then	,	if	you	'll	forgive	the	expression	,	you	're	dead	wrong	.	you	have	no	appreciation	for	the	love	of	the	jesus	that	this	movie	is	about	.	also	,	you	need	to	realize	that	if	you	hate	those	who	put	jesus	to	death	,	then	you	hate	yourself	.	it	was	your	sin	and	mine	that	held	jesus	to	that	cross	.	to	claim	that	it	is	the	sole	fault	of	either	the	romans	or	the	jews	is	folly	.	it	was	our	sin	.	yours	.	mine	.	the	world	's	.	like	my	subject	line	said	,	this	movie	is	brutal	,	visually	punishing	.	it	's	painful	to	sit	there	and	watch	the	nails	sink	into	the	savior	's	hands	and	feet	.	it	's	terrible	,	unbearable	.	but	at	the	same	time	,	the	love	that	held	those	nails	there	,	the	undying	love	for	you	and	i	that	kept	jesus	on	that	cross	is	staggering	it	's	beautiful	.	bottom	line	,	the	movie	is	quite	violent	,	and	i	do	not	recommend	that	any	child	under	15	view	the	movie	.	but	i	do	think	that	it	is	a	very	important	movie	,	one	that	can	deepen	one	's	understanding	of	the	greatest	gift	we	've	been	given	.	25	stars	,	out	of	10	.
in	my	attempt	to	compose	some	semblance	of	thoughts	about	mel	gibson	's	new	film	the	passion	of	christ	.	i	must	admit	i	may	ruffle	some	feathers	,	and	create	some	heated	debate	.	let	me	be	the	first	to	say	any	condemnation	i	place	on	myself	first	.	nothing	i	am	about	to	write	is	an	indictment	of	any	faith	other	than	my	own	personal	self	.	religion	is	such	bondage	.	whether	you	like	it	or	not	,	religion	is	as	flawed	and	cumbersome	as	any	belief	system	.	this	is	why	i	chose	at	a	very	young	age	to	be	a	follower	of	christ	,	because	he	came	and	reformed	the	broken	religions	,	created	and	instilled	a	grace	i	could	never	deserve	.	mel	gibson	's	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	the	kind	of	movie	that	restores	my	faith	in	the	cinema	.	it	is	moving	,	sick	,	beautiful	,	sadistic	,	and	probably	the	most	challenging	two	hours	i	ever	spent	in	a	theater	.	it	is	the	most	violent	,	brutal	,	honest	and	powerful	film	i	have	ever	seen	.	it	the	kind	of	movie	i	do	not	ever	want	to	see	again	and	yet	probably	will	see	many	times	,	because	it	is	that	terrible	to	watch	,	but	also	so	compelling	.	i	left	the	film	changed	and	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	,	something	that	i	thought	was	so	close	to	me	became	more	crystal	clear	then	ever	.	for	the	first	time	i	saw	the	true	power	of	cinema	and	true	power	of	god	's	ultimate	grace	.	i	would	offer	that	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	one	of	the	greatest	and	most	challenging	films	i	have	ever	seen	(	sorry	terry	gilliam	,	but	brazil	is	my	number	2	now	)	.	as	the	film	opens	we	see	a	short	verse	from	the	book	of	isaiah	,	(	anyone	whose	familiar	with	the	heavy	metal	band	stryper	from	80	's	will	remember	this	verse	well	)	but	he	was	pierced	for	our	transgressions	,	he	was	crushed	for	our	iniquities	,	the	punishment	that	brought	us	peacewas	upon	him	,	and	by	his	wounds	we	are	healed	.	isaiah	53	5	(	niv	)	this	passage	was	written	hundreds	of	years	before	before	jesus	christ	was	born	.	according	to	the	new	testement	,	this	verse	was	written	to	tell	of	the	eventual	outcome	of	the	coming	messiah	.	it	is	too	bad	the	high	priests	of	jesus	day	were	so	busy	trying	to	hold	onto	the	religious	control	of	their	people	that	they	missed	the	true	messiah	standing	in	front	of	them	.	in	their	attempt	to	keep	their	grasp	on	the	people	,	they	enlisted	the	help	of	one	of	jesus'	friends	.	they	arrested	jesus	christ	and	carted	him	away	,	placing	him	in	front	of	the	high	priest	caiaphas	.	then	they	dragged	him	in	front	of	the	roman	magistrate	pontius	pilate	.	in	a	less	than	valiant	effort	to	save	his	own	skin	and	politcal	power	,	pilate	pawns	this	man	he	believes	to	be	innocent	in	front	of	the	garish	and	ineffective	figurehead	of	a	king	named	herod	.	herod	sends	jesus	back	in	front	of	pilate	who	does	everything	in	his	power	to	save	this	innocent	man	.	alas	,	he	gave	the	christ	over	to	the	crowd	to	be	scourged	and	ultimately	crucified	.	the	rest	of	the	story	involves	some	of	the	most	realistic	and	brutal	scenes	ever	put	on	film	.	if	you	thought	saving	private	ryan	or	schindler	's	list	was	hard	to	sit	through	,	then	you	cannot	fathom	how	horrible	it	is	watching	christ	get	scourged	,	watching	metal	rip	open	his	skin	.	i	honestly	thought	i	could	take	it	.	i	was	wrong	.	any	person	who	thinks	mankind	is	basically	good	needs	to	watch	how	the	roman	guards	treat	christ	.	the	funny	thing	is	,	i	realize	how	easy	it	would	be	for	me	to	place	myself	in	the	story	.	how	easy	it	would	be	for	me	to	follow	the	crowd	and	how	easy	it	would	be	for	me	to	treat	this	man	as	badly	as	the	roman	guards	treated	him	.	what	i	loved	the	most	about	the	passion	were	the	tiny	moments	when	the	people	who	were	laughing	and	scorning	jesus	soon	realized	who	they	were	dealing	with	.	some	looked	on	with	fear	like	barabbas	or	one	of	the	thieves	on	the	cross	.	others	looked	on	with	reverence	like	the	roman	centurion	who	pierced	jesus'	side	or	simon	,	a	young	man	who	was	thrust	into	the	story	to	help	carry	the	cross	.	it	is	the	small	moments	of	reality	that	hit	these	people	that	make	me	glad	that	sometimes	in	chaos	,	people	can	rise	above	.	i	also	found	myself	in	the	same	boat	as	peter	.	here	is	a	man	who	has	followed	jesus	to	the	mountaintops	.	he	promised	to	stick	by	his	friend	forever	,	yet	when	the	going	gets	tough	,	he	shows	his	cowardice	by	lying	and	denying	his	friend	.	to	be	honest	,	i	shed	many	tears	after	this	scene	.	how	many	times	have	i	done	that	to	save	face	?	how	would	i	have	felt	in	peter	's	situation	?	how	many	times	have	i	have	sold	out	my	friends	for	acceptance	and	to	place	myself	on	a	higher	wrung	?	mel	gibson	has	done	the	unthinkable	.	he	has	created	a	film	that	not	only	incredibly	moving	,	but	also	accessible	.	it	is	hard	to	try	to	put	the	life	of	jesus	into	the	context	of	his	death	because	it	seems	so	pointless	.	what	did	this	man	do	to	deserve	the	pain	of	the	cross	?	why	do	people	revere	him	so	much	?	why	do	so	many	blindly	follow	?	mostly	,	why	is	a	man	like	christ	worth	the	fuss	?	it	is	simple	.	we	as	humans	treated	god	like	a	piece	of	junk	and	yet	he	forgave	us	.	this	whole	episode	was	necessary	to	human	existence	.	the	final	ten	minutes	of	the	passion	are	both	moving	and	damaging	all	at	the	same	time	.	as	jesus	dies	the	screen	goes	black	for	what	seems	like	an	eternity	.	it	was	not	nearly	enough	time	to	compose	myself	,	but	what	follows	is	a	sweetly	lyrical	approach	to	the	resurrection	that	does	what	it	needs	to	.	so	many	films	leave	christ	hanging	there	,	in	their	own	way	acknowledging	that	he	may	have	had	a	bunch	of	great	ideas	,	but	beyond	that	,	who	cares	?	without	the	resurrection	,	the	crucifixion	is	an	innocent	man	getting	the	tar	beaten	out	of	him	for	45	minutes	.	with	the	resurrection	,	the	crucifixion	is	a	story	of	hope	and	of	grace	something	i	do	not	deserve	.	the	cast	is	phenomenal	.	jim	caviezel	,	monica	bellucci	,	and	maia	morgenstern	hit	the	right	cords	when	they	have	to	.	playing	these	characters	is	difficult	because	there	is	always	a	tendency	to	over	and	or	underplay	them	.	they	also	fill	in	a	canvas	that	borders	on	realistic	and	stylized	.	i	do	not	think	anyone	with	even	any	ounce	of	compassion	could	not	be	moved	by	the	pain	of	watching	morgenstern	(	who	plays	mother	mary	)	and	bellucci	(	as	mary	magdelene	)	wipe	up	the	blood	of	christ	.	i	would	love	to	hear	what	those	who	disagree	with	me	have	to	say	.	i	would	love	to	hear	what	those	whom	have	no	christian	faith	think	of	this	film	.	even	if	you	do	disagree	,	do	me	a	favor	.	if	your	mind	and	soul	are	in	for	a	challenging	and	deeply	troubling	film	,	give	the	passion	of	the	christ	your	attention	.	even	if	you	are	unfazed	,	i	promise	the	film	is	brilliant	,	and	i	have	only	said	that	about	five	films	in	my	lifetime	.	you	may	just	leave	the	theater	at	least	a	little	changed	.	you	may	have	a	sense	of	deep	despair	or	tons	of	joy	,	but	you	will	leave	with	just	a	tad	bit	more	compassion	.
directors	mel	gibson	and	michael	moore	(	fahrenheit	9	11	)	stirred	controversy	in	2004	for	their	films	.	many	loved	them	,	many	hated	them	.	regardless	,	their	names	were	undeniable	that	year	.	the	passion	of	the	christ	,	mel	gibson	's	directorial	follow	up	to	the	oscar	winning	braveheart	(	1995	)	,	takes	christianity	to	a	new	level	.	it	stars	jim	caviezel	(	pay	it	forward	)	and	monica	bellucci	(	irreversable	)	.	this	film	portrays	the	last	12	hours	of	jesus	christ	's	life	.	through	the	graphic	images	and	the	powerful	dialect	is	one	of	the	most	unforgettable	films	of	that	year	and	of	ever	.	this	film	does	n't	play	part	fiction	,	part	non	fiction	it	plays	according	to	to	the	bible	and	other	testaments	.	this	film	never	holds	back	on	its	soul	.	meanwhile	,	it	made	film	history	in	many	ways	.	beyond	the	controversy	is	one	of	the	most	remarkable	films	about	religion	.	though	occassionally	some	scenes	run	too	slow	,	and	some	text	is	unnecessarily	repetitive	,	its	strengths	lie	upon	its	ability	to	tell	a	story	thoroughly	.	the	emotional	aspect	never	fades	from	when	jesus	is	captured	to	the	end	.	through	the	torture	,	the	blood	,	the	humiliation	,	and	the	death	,	some	tears	may	fall	.	though	the	conclusion	is	unquestionable	to	first	time	viewers	,	the	powerful	message	remains	at	its	peak	.	beyond	the	last	12	hours	of	jesus	's	life	also	shares	his	beliefs	and	his	own	faith	.	such	written	quality	was	approved	by	many	christian	churches	and	organizations	.	therefore	,	this	film	became	the	symbol	of	their	religion	.	the	physical	aspects	of	the	film	are	accurate	to	those	from	the	actual	early	first	century	living	through	the	costumes	and	the	sets	.	they	resemble	the	pictures	from	the	testaments	and	history	books	.	the	strong	demands	for	them	were	met	beautifully	.	jesus	's	physical	state	during	his	torture	is	wonderfully	portrayed	with	make	up	.	the	blood	,	the	sweat	,	and	bruises	add	to	the	powerful	standpoint	that	the	film	deserves	.	through	the	work	,	jim	caviezel	may	have	been	mistaken	for	the	actual	jesus	christ	.	its	close	graphic	images	were	necessary	to	include	and	were	wonderfully	crafted	,	proving	the	level	of	pain	endured	.	such	crew	work	quality	earned	this	film	three	oscar	nominations	best	make	up	,	best	cinematography	,	and	best	original	score	.	though	all	the	actors	portrayed	their	characters	wonderfully	,	jim	caviezel	,	monica	bellucci	,	and	maia	morgenstern	stand	out	.	caviezel	's	performance	as	jesus	christ	could	not	have	been	done	better	.	his	state	of	pain	in	itself	,	though	a	few	scenes	were	real	,	gives	new	life	to	this	film	.	this	proved	highly	difficult	since	he	was	in	that	state	of	sadness	or	pain	through	most	of	the	film	.	morgenstern	's	portrayal	of	mary	proved	as	emotional	as	caviezel	's	.	though	she	did	n't	say	much	,	her	facial	expressions	alone	reveal	mary	's	times	,	especially	witnessing	jesus	's	torture	.	such	overall	film	quality	makes	the	passion	of	the	christ	worth	watching	at	least	once	,	christian	or	not	.	due	to	the	graphic	nature	,	this	is	not	recommended	for	children	or	the	faint	of	heart	.	viewers	should	use	their	own	discretion	.	few	will	end	this	film	feeling	nothing	.	therefore	,	this	will	surely	remain	commonly	talked	about	to	its	viewers	,	even	those	who	dislike	it	.
everyone	(	except	very	young	children	)	should	see	this	movie	.	it	is	one	of	the	most	important	films	of	our	time	,	and	will	open	dialog	in	families	and	churches	and	among	people	everywhere	.	the	way	the	movie	was	presented	,	from	the	garden	of	gethsemene	to	the	end	,	it	was	like	i	was	a	witness	to	what	was	happening	in	front	of	me	.	yes	,	it	was	violent	,	but	not	from	beginning	to	end	,	as	some	critics	suggest	.	it	was	hard	to	watch	at	times	,	but	the	violence	was	not	gratuitous	.	the	story	pulled	me	in	and	kept	me	there	,	and	by	the	time	it	was	over	,	i	could	n't	speak	.	mel	gibson	did	an	incredible	job	with	this	movie	.	i	think	it	looks	more	like	a	100	million	film	instead	of	25	million	,	as	far	as	the	costumes	,	settings	,	and	the	use	of	aramic	and	latin	languages	.	the	actors	are	fabulous	as	well	,	especially	jim	caviezel	as	jesus	and	moira	morganstern	as	mary	,	jesus'	mother	.	thank	you	again	,	mel	,	for	doing	this	.	a	wonderful	job	.
mel	gibson	's	epic	masterpiece	is	the	feel	good	hit	of	the	summer	!	tina	turner	shines	in	her	role	as	mary	(	especially	in	the	memorable	scene	where	she	defiantly	sings	better	be	good	to	me	while	pleading	her	case	before	pilate	(	a	never	funnier	adam	sandler	!	)	and	the	casting	of	bobcat	goldthwaite	as	jesus	is	pure	genius	.	gibson	's	decision	to	have	the	cast	speak	the	entire	dialog	in	esperanto	points	to	his	trademark	attention	to	historical	accuracy	and	detail	!	the	dvd	is	jam	packed	with	extras	.	an	entire	brownshirt	uniform	and	a	miniature	replica	of	mein	kampf	that	you	can	read	to	the	kids	before	bedtime	!	hands	down	the	best	anti	semitic	propaganda	film	since	leni	oh	c'mon	,	it	's	just	a	movie	!	reifenstahl	's	triumph	of	the	will	!	an	excellent	distraction	from	the	war	in	iraq	and	the	2004	election	!	two	steins	up	!
the	first	point	i	would	like	to	make	is	that	anyone	that	viewed	this	film	is	responsible	for	the	message	contained	in	it	.	this	was	not	a	film	about	emotion	,	brutallity	,	anti	seminism	or	the	cruelty	of	rome	.	this	was	a	power	packed	film	about	man	's	relationship	to	god	.	the	fact	that	mr	.	gibson	was	inspired	by	his	own	faith	and	relationship	with	god	and	not	emotional	content	shows	the	commitment	that	he	has	and	the	courage	to	tell	the	story	as	it	was	.	the	cinematography	was	excellent	,	the	acting	marvelous	in	light	of	the	weighty	subject	depicted	.	some	have	said	that	this	film	is	not	for	children	or	those	of	a	frail	mein	.	i	object	and	suggest	that	any	child	that	has	reached	the	age	of	accountability	must	see	this	film	so	that	they	can	make	their	own	mind	up	about	this	event	.	the	weak	or	frail	that	are	looking	for	the	moment	of	ultimate	truth	must	see	this	film	.	if	we	look	at	this	film	and	judge	it	by	the	same	standard	that	we	judged	king	of	kings	starring	jeffrey	hunter	or	the	bible	with	an	all	star	cast	then	i	believe	that	we	miss	the	point	entirely	.	mel	gibson	is	the	first	director	in	hollywood	that	has	the	intestinal	fortitude	(	guts	)	to	tell	the	story	as	it	really	happened	and	please	note	that	often	those	accused	of	a	capital	crime	did	not	survive	the	scouraging	in	order	to	be	crucified	.	god	's	wrath	was	not	the	object	of	this	movie	either	.	why	would	god	willing	send	his	own	son	to	a	horrifying	death	in	order	to	redeem	mankind	and	then	take	it	out	on	the	very	humanity	that	that	death	was	planned	for	before	adam	and	eve	were	even	created	.	that	would	be	tantamount	to	murder	.	there	is	much	debate	about	the	false	doctrine	of	evaloution	and	i	submit	that	this	film	in	all	it	's	cinematic	gore	and	brutallity	forces	a	decision	to	be	made	by	everyone	that	sees	it	.	the	fact	that	mel	gibson	invested	33	million	dollars	of	his	own	finances	into	this	project	shows	dedication	,	sacrifice	commitment	.	do	n't	forget	that	those	that	would	not	support	gibson	financially	,	now	wish	that	they	had	,	since	the	movie	has	made	approximately	100	times	mel	's	investment	.	hollywood	would	rather	pervert	the	gospels	(	good	news	)	and	portray	jesus	christ	as	a	man	with	homosexual	tendicies	than	tell	the	truth	,	for	obvious	reasons	.	it	appeared	to	me	that	even	the	cast	of	this	film	was	changed	by	it	.	in	summary	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	the	focal	point	,	the	pivital	point	in	the	relationship	between	god	and	man	and	the	attemps	throughout	the	ages	of	the	evil	one	satan	formerly	lucifer	son	of	the	morning	and	the	chief	archangel	of	god	,	to	thwart	god	's	plan	to	redeem	(	buy	back	)	man	from	sin	and	bondage	to	this	current	world	system	.	if	you	miss	this	point	of	the	film	then	you	reduce	the	passion	to	entertainment	and	that	diminishes	all	of	humanity	.	i	do	n't	care	if	you	are	a	believer	of	not	,	the	healthy	do	not	need	the	services	of	a	doctor	,	but	the	unhealthy	do	.	mel	gibson	made	a	film	about	a	choice	between	heaven	and	hell	and	everyone	that	sees	this	film	will	be	held	accountable	for	what	they	now	know	are	the	facts	.	the	cinematography	,	look	and	feel	of	the	sets	was	tangible	and	unforgettable	.	the	acting	was	very	moving	and	well	done	.	the	wardrobe	was	very	well	done	and	the	music	was	paced	right	in	time	with	the	sequence	of	events	.	this	movie	is	a	must	see	for	all	seekers	of	truth	.
not	to	mention	his	father	is	a	rabid	antisemite	.	those	two	facts	alone	should	negate	this	entire	film	.	no	i	havent	seen	it	,	i	dnt	need	to	see	this	garbage	to	know	it	's	fiction
i	love	this	movie	.	it	has	a	real	sactifying	effect	on	me	each	time	i	watch	it	.	it	reminds	me	of	all	the	pain	and	suffering	my	jesus	went	through	for	me	and	everyone	else	.	it	also	helps	me	remember	my	basic	aramaic	studies	too
a	respectfully	done	version	of	the	life	and	ministry	of	the	only	son	of	god	,	our	lord	and	savior	jesus	christ	.	a	must	see	for	all	.
the	absolute	best	movie	about	jesus	christ	,	movie	in	general	ever	to	be	made	.	hollywood	and	media	fought	tooth	and	nail	to	stop	it	.	the	more	hollywood	and	usa	media	tried	the	more	popular	it	became	.	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	passion	of	the	christ	is	the	number	1	most	watched	movie	in	the	history	on	cinema	,	and	has	grossed	nearly	2	,	that	's	2	billion	so	far	.	the	passion	has	sold	more	copies	,	than	any	other	movie	in	the	history	of	cinama	.	this	grand	and	true	statistic	is	edited	out	of	the	news	,	99	of	the	time	to	discourage	sales	.	it	has	only	continued	to	sell	at	lightening	speed	to	this	day	.	truth	,	honesty	and	objectivity	sells	forever	,	as	gibson	's	mega	epic	will	.	see	this	incredible	masterpiece	and	be	moved	beyond	the	limits	of	your	mind	to	feel	a	lifting	of	your	troubles	,	and	a	new	and	so	welcomed	sense	of	courage	come	into	your	soul	and	heart	.	i	have	to	i	need	to	watch	the	passion	at	least	once	a	year	to	rejuvinate	my	soul	.	see	it	for	yourself	.	nothing	you	will	ever	watch	in	your	life	,	will	be	as	inordinately	inspiring	as	mel	gibson	's	the	passion	of	the	christ	.
mel	gibson	's	film	about	the	trasgression	of	jesus	christ	's	life	is	vividly	portrayed	in	this	film	.	you	will	see	how	a	men	crucify	an	innocent	man	who	claims	to	be	'the	son	of	god'	.	he	will	die	a	brutal	death	for	this	claim	,	and	history	shows	us	that	jesus'	death	has	lasted	a	lifetime	.	the	film	and	history	proclaim	that	jesus	died	for	all	our	sins	.	the	most	selfless	human	act	ever	recorded	by	jesus	christ	and	by	god	his	father	.	infinite	stars	.
the	only	thing	i	regret	is	not	having	held	the	purchase	of	this	film	until	this	definite	edition	came	along	which	,	judging	by	the	bare	boneness	of	the	previous	one	,	was	very	much	a	fact	.	still	,	this	dvd	is	very	much	worth	of	a	double	dip	,	there	are	so	many	hard	to	interpret	details	throughout	the	film	that	mel	gibson	's	commentary	should	be	most	enlighting	.	i	can	understand	that	unless	seen	under	the	conviction	of	christ	's	divinity	,	the	violence	of	this	film	is	totally	pointless	(	and	appalling	)	.	roger	ebert	was	right	to	call	it	the	most	violent	movie	ever	made	.	for	christians	however	,	this	is	obliged	viewing	.	judge	mel	gibson	all	you	want	but	at	least	he	has	done	one	undeniably	good	thing	which	,	in	no	exageration	,	has	been	life	changing	to	more	than	a	few	.	how	many	people	can	say	that	?
i	have	never	seen	a	movie	which	shows	the	true	suffering	of	christ	before	during	and	after	the	cruicifiction	.	even	though	,	it	has	subtitles	they	are	unnecessary	to	understand	what	is	being	said	.
i	was	one	of	those	who	was	surprised	by	the	extensive	critiques	of	the	film	as	anti	jewish	.	believing	the	film	simply	reported	what	was	in	the	gospels	.	many	years	later	,	my	understanding	of	the	critique	has	deepened	.	christianity	has	for	two	millenia	treated	jews	as	responsible	for	the	crucifixion	,	and	utterly	rejected	jesus'	commandments	to	love	thy	god	with	all	thy	heart	,	and	love	thy	neigbhour	,	as	well	as	other	important	commandments	to	not	embrace	mammon	,	and	not	exalt	themselves	.	the	history	of	christianity	is	a	history	of	hate	thy	neighbour	especially	the	jewish	ones	,	and	follow	mammon	at	all	costs	including	the	colonization	of	other	nations	,	the	slavery	,	exploitation	and	even	genocide	of	their	people	(	eg	.	the	millions	of	natives	killed	in	the	americas	)	.	how	does	gibson	's	film	feed	the	anti	jesus	practices	of	christianity	?	it	focuses	on	the	church	's	teachings	that	jesus'	suffering	'paid'	for	humanity	's	sins	,	so	that	those	who	'believe'	in	him	are	'saved'	,	whereas	those	who	do	not	,	especially	the	jews	,	go	to	hell	.	simply	put	,	jesus	never	said	or	encouraged	such	absurd	notions	.	on	the	contrary	,	he	specifically	said	'i	come	not	to	save	the	world	.	'	.	and	his	parable	of	the	pharisee	and	the	tax	collector	specifically	contradicts	the	arrogance	of	christians	who	imagine	they	are	already	'saved'	because	they	believe	in	him	as	the	'universal'	saviour	,	when	he	himself	contradicted	these	notions	.	by	focussing	morbidly	on	the	beatings	,	torture	,	and	crucifixion	of	jesus	,	carried	out	by	sadistic	romans	,	not	jewish	priests	(	who	simply	wanted	him	dead	)	,	gibson	encourages	precisely	the	wrong	teachings	of	the	church	,	which	jesus'	own	statements	deny	and	contradict	.	no	doubt	it	is	based	on	a	sincere	effort	by	gibson	to	portray	what	he	has	been	taught	,	but	those	teachings	are	a	distortion	of	what	jesus	himself	said	.	but	then	it	is	foolish	to	expect	a	hollywood	star	later	exposed	as	an	anti	jew	in	his	arrest	in	california	in	a	drunken	state	making	rabidly	anti	jewish	ravings	to	understand	,	let	alone	convey	,	the	true	teachings	of	one	of	the	great	masters	.
i	knew	the	story	already	,	and	i	have	seen	probably	all	the	classic	passion	movies	.	the	only	thing	different	is	more	graphic	(	really	graphic	)	violence	.	i	know	jesus	suffered	horribly	.	what	is	the	point	?	i	do	n't	need	to	see	him	whipped	to	a	bloody	pulp	with	grisly	implements	.	with	mel	gibson	's	heavy	handed	direction	,	it	was	like	watching	a	senseless	slasher	movie	.	after	a	while	you	just	go	numb	.	this	film	is	nothing	new	.	the	story	has	been	told	before	,	and	with	much	more	finesse	.

it	disturbs	me	that	so	many	people	like	this	movie	as	much	as	they	do	.	yes	it	is	well	made	and	well	directed	,	but	it	reminds	me	of	a	really	bloody	child	's	tale	.	except	for	the	fact	that	it	is	so	violent	,	it	could	easily	be	a	kid	's	movie	.	it	is	so	simple	none	of	the	complexities	of	jesus'	life	and	statements	are	examined	at	all	.	this	movie	should	just	be	called	the	torture	of	jesus	.	or	jesus	got	it	really	,	really	,	really	bad	.	or	jesus	had	a	lot	of	blood	,	want	to	see	it	all	?	really	,	think	about	how	simple	this	movie	was	,	no	ambiguity	,	no	in	depth	discussion	of	his	teachings	and	his	often	(	seemingly	)	contradictory	statements	.	every	statement	jesus	makes	is	non	political	,	and	non	controversial	,	except	of	course	for	when	he	says	those	who	brought	me	to	you	bear	the	greater	sin	.	meaning	of	course	the	jews	bear	the	greater	sin	.	other	than	that	we	get	a	very	dumbed	down	version	of	jesus	and	his	teachings	,	the	wine	is	my	blood	,	the	bread	is	my	flesh	,	etc	.	no	statements	from	jesus	regarding	how	hard	it	is	for	rich	people	to	get	into	heaven	(	paging	mel	gibson	,	paging	mel	gibson	)	or	how	he	thought	money	lenders	were	bad	etc	.	would	jesus	really	want	a	movie	made	about	him	that	focused	this	exclusively	and	morbidly	on	his	death	?	why	not	do	a	movie	on	the	life	of	jesus	?	that	is	much	more	important	than	his	death	,	his	teachings	,	wanderings	,	etc	.	but	that	movie	would	not	sell	nearly	as	many	tickets	as	this	movie	will	and	that	brings	us	to	the	truth	about	this	movie	and	the	crux	of	the	matter	.	this	movie	is	nothing	but	an	excuse	for	people	to	watch	someone	get	tortured	and	rationalize	it	as	a	religious	,	spiritual	experience	,	a	vehicle	by	which	an	average	person	can	indulge	in	sadism	and	write	it	off	as	religious	education	.	there	is	no	way	this	movie	would	ever	be	viewed	as	anything	but	a	big	budget	torture	flick	if	jesus	were	not	the	one	being	tortured	.	think	about	it	,	is	that	not	the	only	reason	it	is	o	.	k	.	for	normal	people	to	enjoy	this	movie	,	because	it	is	jesus	getting	tortured	,	not	someone	else	?	do	people	really	like	this	movie	so	much	because	it	is	so	spiritual	and	religious	,	or	because	it	is	so	bloody	and	sick	?	honestly	,	everyone	who	is	reading	this	knows	i	am	right	even	if	they	do	not	want	to	admit	it	,	the	main	attraction	here	is	not	jesus	or	christianity	,	it	is	torture	and	blood	.	i	guarantee	that	if	this	movie	where	mostly	about	christ	's	life	,	and	did	not	focus	almost	exclusively	on	his	death	it	would	not	be	nearly	as	successful	.	this	movie	is	nothing	but	a	sadomasochistic	experience	thinly	disguised	as	a	religious	experience	.	i	saw	this	movie	with	a	crowd	full	of	glazed	eyed	fanatics	who	looked	to	me	like	they	were	getting	of	on	jesus'	treatment	,	while	convincing	themselves	they	were	getting	closer	to	god	.	please	,	if	anything	this	movie	was	satanic	in	its	meticulous	,	detailed	,	and	yes	,	loving	attention	to	each	facet	of	jesus'	torture	.	if	you	like	watching	suffering	,	you	will	love	this	movie	!	the	official	amozon	.	com	reviewer	,	the	always	dependably	disingenuous	establishment	intellectual	jeff	shannon	,	(	do	us	all	a	favor	and	retire	,	please	!	)	review	differed	only	from	the	rest	of	the	wild	eyed	gibson	's	cult	's	reviews	in	its	sophistication	and	veneer	of	objectivity	.	mel	gibson	was	so	brave	to	make	this	film	,	oh	we	should	admire	his	aplomb	,	his	refusal	to	bow	to	convention	,	his	spiritual	and	intellectual	independence	,	i	am	getting	teary	eyed	just	thinking	about	his	pure	motives	in	making	this	movie	!	give	me	a	break	!	gibson	is	a	fanatic	with	an	agenda	and	the	money	to	finance	it	.	however	,	this	is	america	and	just	like	everyone	else	he	has	the	right	to	make	any	sort	of	movie	he	wants	,	i	am	no	censor	,	and	do	not	advocate	banning	this	film	.	that	being	said	,	i	do	not	think	gibson	deserves	admiration	simply	for	being	controversial	as	our	intellectual	guru	mr	.	shannon	seems	to	think	,	by	that	standard	the	kkk	would	also	deserve	admiration	.	he	has	a	right	to	make	this	film	,	but	that	does	not	make	him	brave	,	just	fanatical	.	now	on	to	the	most	important	and	dangerous	part	of	this	movie	,	the	anti	semitism	.	this	movie	is	anti	semitic	,	perhaps	not	as	much	as	advertised	,	but	there	are	defiantly	jewish	stereotypes	in	here	.	all	the	jews	that	love	jesus	are	normal	looking	and	nice	,	all	the	ones	that	do	not	love	jesus	are	seedy	,	ugly	,	scheming	,	and	scum	.	and	for	those	who	think	this	movie	is	not	anti	semitic	just	read	some	of	the	reviews	written	by	anti	semites	praising	this	movie	and	then	tell	me	i	am	wrong	.	gibson	's	father	has	stated	that	the	holocaust	never	happened	and	gibson	supports	that	statement	of	his	father	's	.	there	is	nothing	intellectually	challenging	about	this	movie	at	all	,	jesus	got	horribly	tortured	,	the	jews	were	responsible	,	enjoy	the	torture	while	faking	disgust	,	then	blame	the	jews	for	everything	.	pretty	convenient	for	viewers	huh	?	they	do	not	have	to	think	,	they	get	to	be	entertained	and	indulge	their	unspeakable	desires	,	then	get	to	turn	around	and	blame	it	all	on	someone	else	,	thereby	displacing	the	guilt	you	feel	for	enjoying	this	film	in	the	first	place	.	rich	fanatical	christians	are	buying	up	blocks	of	tickets	and	giving	them	away	for	free	!	what	other	movie	in	history	has	had	people	do	that	.	that	alone	shows	that	this	movie	has	a	serious	agenda	.	the	characters	in	this	movie	lack	depth	and	so	does	the	film	itself	.	i	guarantee	that	this	movie	will	become	a	cult	hit	for	anti	semites	and	religious	nuts	just	like	gibson	himself	.	if	you	do	not	believe	me	,	just	wait	and	see	!
passion	of	the	christ	is	a	must	have	dvd	(	or	video	)	it	is	horrifying	,	graphic	,	detailed	and	yet	enlightening	.	i	cried	through	the	entire	movie	.	that	's	how	much	impact	this	movie	had	on	me	.	though	sub	titled	,	it	is	easily	followed	.	and	since	i	just	finished	reading	the	bible	again	,	the	scenes	you	can	recall	from	the	kjv	bible	.	christ	endured	so	much	torture	and	agony	for	us	to	take	away	our	sins	.	and	this	is	not	fiction	.	it	is	the	truth	!	even	if	you	do	n't	believe	fully	in	god	and	jesus	christ	,	watch	this	movie	.	it	just	may	change	your	mind	on	how	his	life	was	and	what	he	went	through	for	all	of	us	.	i	love	mel	gibson	as	an	actor	.	maverick	,	lethal	weapon	series	,	etc	.	but	as	a	director	,	i	saw	a	true	artist	.	this	was	his	vision	of	how	he	saw	what	christ	endured	.	and	he	followed	the	bible	closely	.	pure	talent	.	exceptional	movie	.	a	collectors	item	,	definitely	!
i	normally	do	n't	write	reviews	of	movies	since	i	do	n't	go	to	see	many	of	them	because	they	are	usually	such	nonsensical	hollywood	crap	.	but	after	reading	a	couple	hundred	reviews	of	this	dvd	,	i	could	n't	resist	adding	my	two	cents	.	i	did	see	the	movie	when	it	first	came	out	,	and	i	bought	several	copies	of	the	dvd	for	myself	and	family	members	because	it	is	truly	a	transformational	piece	of	artistry	and	guidance	of	how	to	conduct	your	life	for	the	short	time	we	get	to	inhabit	the	planet	.	most	of	the	comments	i	read	did	not	actually	deal	with	the	importance	of	gibson	's	contribution	to	civilization	.	jesus	was	an	important	contributor	to	the	advancement	of	civilization	because	he	did	something	that	is	so	rare	in	human	events	.	he	was	willing	to	die	for	changing	a	corrupt	world	and	make	it	more	loving	,	accepting	,	and	inclusive	.	religion	has	always	been	a	force	for	good	and	evil	because	it	is	used	by	those	who	want	to	advance	their	own	agenda	rather	than	that	of	the	originator	of	a	particular	religion	.	this	is	true	whether	the	focus	was	worshiping	fire	,	water	,	cows	,	snakes	,	a	human	individual	,	and	many	other	idols	.	humans	are	different	from	our	fellow	apes	because	we	actually	try	to	understand	the	unknowable	of	why	we	are	here	,	and	what	we	should	do	in	guiding	us	now	that	we	are	capable	of	more	than	just	sitting	around	a	fire	cooking	the	day	's	catch	.	muhammad	's	words	are	used	as	an	excuse	for	jihad	by	lunatics	who	kill	randomly	and	wantonly	to	advance	their	view	of	the	koran	to	kill	any	nonbelievers	.	the	high	priests	of	the	temple	of	david	were	threatened	by	a	blasphemer	when	he	pointed	out	the	violation	of	having	money	changers	in	the	temple	.	the	high	priests	in	spain	and	medieval	europe	roasted	other	blasphemers	in	violation	of	the	words	of	the	christ	they	supposedly	worshiped	as	their	god	.	what	gibson	does	with	his	work	is	to	point	out	that	we	all	have	a	choice	,	actually	many	choices	in	life	,	to	choose	the	path	of	forgiveness	and	love	of	our	fellow	man	,	regardless	of	how	they	have	violated	any	sense	of	humanity	towards	our	fellow	man	,	or	go	the	way	of	rome	at	the	time	of	jesus	(	or	berlin	and	moscow	in	the	30	's	and	40	's	)	.	it	is	really	the	only	thing	that	makes	us	different	from	our	ancestors	who	climbed	down	from	the	trees	millions	of	years	ago	and	moved	all	over	the	planet	.	i	find	it	especially	telling	that	those	who	watch	something	like	the	texas	chainsaw	massacre	and	do	n't	feel	a	need	to	write	a	review	about	such	gratuitous	violence	can	give	a	one	star	to	a	movie	which	is	focused	on	the	horrible	suffering	of	scourging	and	crucifixion	two	millennia	ago	of	someone	who	preached	honesty	,	love	,	compassion	,	forgiveness	,	and	inclusiveness	when	the	ruling	order	of	the	day	was	sacrificing	goats	for	signs	of	divine	guidance	.	this	is	one	of	the	real	classics	of	movie	making	.	it	is	not	for	the	faint	of	heart	,	because	dying	for	the	sins	of	your	fellow	man	is	a	rare	event	.	no	other	major	religion	is	based	upon	such	a	selfless	individual	.	it	is	why	it	has	transformed	the	world	from	one	of	conan	the	barbarian	and	his	predecessors	and	successors	to	one	where	we	think	of	something	other	than	ourselves	and	our	selfish	human	passions	.	of	course	humans	being	humans	,	the	forces	of	evil	are	on	the	march	,	as	exemplified	by	the	suicide	bombings	in	israel	,	ossetia	,	new	york	,	washington	,	bali	,	kenya	,	tanzania	,	yemen	,	germany	,	etc	.	gibson	deserves	every	dime	he	was	rewarded	with	for	reminding	us	of	the	transformational	nature	of	the	message	of	jesus	the	jew	to	mankind	.	whether	you	think	of	jesus	as	the	christ	or	not	,	you	cannot	find	a	better	advocate	for	all	the	principles	that	we	take	for	granted	today	in	the	west	,	including	those	on	the	upper	west	side	or	west	hollywood	who	have	never	done	anything	but	shoot	their	mouths	off	while	hundreds	of	thousands	have	given	their	blood	and	bodies	for	mankind	.	every	time	i	walk	among	the	thousands	of	crosses	in	american	cemeteries	all	over	europe	,	and	especially	in	places	like	normandy	,	where	brave	young	men	gave	their	lives	,	not	for	conquest	or	commercial	gain	but	so	that	others	could	be	free	,	i	understand	their	sacrifice	and	the	appropriateness	of	marking	it	with	the	symbol	of	what	christ	did	to	inspire	all	of	mankind	.	this	movie	shows	you	how	it	all	started	and	what	a	magnificent	gift	of	selflessness	it	was	.
this	is	a	movie	i	have	avoided	watching	until	a	few	days	ago	.	i	am	glad	i	watched	this	,	the	suffering	of	christ	is	very	accurately	portrayed	.
'the	passion	of	the	christ'	is	an	extremely	graphic	motion	picture	that	depicts	the	gruesome	torture	death	of	jesus	christ	.	i'm	not	going	to	give	a	summary	about	this	film	because	everyone	should	already	know	what	it	's	about	.	this	movie	was	very	dramatic	,	very	emotional	,	and	extremely	unsettling	.	the	film	contains	the	most	graphic	scourging	scene	in	movie	history	!	i	would	n't	let	your	children	watch	this	.	wait	until	they	get	a	bit	older	.	the	acting	is	superb	,	the	story	,	script	,	and	characters	are	incredible	.	the	soundtrack	is	depressingly	atmospheric	.	whether	you	're	a	believer	or	not	,	this	movie	is	well	worth	a	look	.	you	'll	walk	away	a	changed	person	.
i	saw	the	passion	of	the	christ	several	months	ago	when	it	was	first	released	in	theaters	,	however	it	's	message	of	unconditional	love	and	selfless	sacrifice	remain	indelibly	etched	in	my	mind	.	as	any	who	have	caught	wind	of	the	film	well	know	,	it	is	visually	,	the	most	graphic	depiction	of	christ	's	final	hours	ever	conceived	.	unlike	many	others	though	,	i	feel	as	though	the	its	graphic	nature	only	acts	as	a	catalyst	to	enhance	the	viwer	's	grasp	of	the	magnitude	of	the	sacrifice	christ	made	to	absolve	us	of	our	sins	.	granted	,	it	may	be	too	violnet	for	others	,	especially	those	who	are	used	to	the	archetypical	,	bloodless	version	of	christ	's	crucifixion	,	which	we	've	become	so	accustomed	to	from	movies	past	.	my	best	advice	to	those	who	are	debating	on	whether	or	not	they	're	willing	to	see	it	,	is	that	christian	or	not	,	everyone	can	benefit	positively	from	what	this	film	has	to	say	.
amazing	and	powerful	film	.	the	dvd	is	a	let	down	.	absolutely	no	features	,	not	even	a	trailer	reads	.	play	movie	,	language	selection	and	scene	selection	.	well	,	i	guess	the	movie	was	n't	all	that	popular	to	begin	with	,	eh	?	ha	!
i	come	to	this	review	a	christian	woman	strong	in	the	faith	of	god	,	but	will	try	to	review	using	my	intellect	.	whether	you	believe	that	christ	is	the	savior	of	man	,	this	movie	can	be	appreciated	for	its	bravery	.	i	kept	thinking	when	will	this	end	,	even	though	i	knew	exactly	when	.	the	sobs	were	caught	so	deeply	in	my	throat	that	i	could	hardly	breath	.	that	any	man	,	and	regardless	of	belief	,	he	was	a	man	as	well	as	god	so	his	doubts	and	constant	fight	for	faith	that	what	was	happening	to	him	was	for	the	greater	good	is	to	be	understood	.	the	pain	that	was	endured	so	that	all	could	know	the	lord	even	though	we	are	completely	unworthy	is	astounding	.	i	knew	what	would	happen	and	i	thought	that	i	was	prepared	.	i	was	wrong	.	even	my	wildest	imagination	could	not	have	conceived	the	agony	of	these	final	hours	.	i	have	read	many	reviews	on	this	movie	that	are	fighting	about	the	nature	of	his	love	rather	than	the	nature	of	his	death	.	but	really	,	do	n't	they	go	hand	in	hand	?	who	but	someone	who	loves	with	every	fiber	of	his	soul	could	endure	this	kind	of	torture	for	the	salvation	of	those	that	he	loved	?	would	i	lay	down	my	life	for	my	children	?	in	a	heartbeat	.	would	i	endure	unimaginable	torture	to	spare	them	from	the	very	same	?	without	doubt	!	would	the	pain	cause	me	to	waiver	?	quite	possibly	.	would	i	continue	anyway	?	beyond	question	.	this	was	a	movie	that	left	me	wanting	to	consider	the	great	and	horrible	things	that	all	mankind	is	capable	of	and	how	i	could	make	a	difference	.	just	watch	and	ask	yourself	if	you	could	do	the	same	for	those	that	you	love	.
mel	gibson	's	film	is	as	beautiful	and	startling	as	a	caravagio	painting	.	and	mind	you	,	it	's	hard	to	call	a	film	full	of	grotesque	violence	as	beautiful	.	it	's	passion	depiction	is	cruel	and	frightening	.	as	it	should	be	.	no	more	comfortable	crucifixion	movie	scenes	.	thank	god	.	the	flogging	depicted	was	probably	worse	than	what	really	happened	.	as	a	shroud	of	turin	believer	,	i	believe	that	jesus	was	horribly	flogged	by	a	flagrum	that	featured	dumb	bell	shaped	pellets	of	wood	or	bone	.	not	a	flagrum	with	sharp	metal	blades	.	christ	's	entire	body	was	blistered	and	bleeding	,	but	probably	not	shredded	as	it	was	in	this	film	.	it	would	be	hard	to	believe	that	anyone	would	be	able	to	bear	a	cross	.	or	even	walk	.	after	what	this	film	shows	as	the	scourging	.	as	an	artistic	depiction	,	however	,	the	overdone	scourging	depicts	how	it	must	had	felt	for	our	savior	.	the	agony	.	as	for	whether	the	film	is	anti	semitic	or	not	,	simply	read	the	account	written	by	the	roman	jewish	historian	,	josephus	.	josephus	writes	of	a	jewish	prophet	that	came	after	christ	,	who	preached	the	downfall	of	the	temple	.	the	sanhedrin	arrested	him	,	and	turned	him	over	to	the	roman	governor	.	he	was	scourged	by	the	roman	governor	and	set	free	.	and	the	angry	sanhedrin	was	n't	very	pleased	.	a	stealth	assassin	ended	up	killing	this	prophet	of	doom	with	a	stone	.	thus	,	josephus	confirms	that	the	jewish	government	of	that	generation	would	turn	a	fellow	jew	over	to	the	gentiles	,	if	such	a	brethern	dared	to	oppose	them	in	any	way	.	as	the	final	closer	to	this	controversy	,	jesus	said	that	no	man	could	take	his	life	.	only	he	could	lie	it	down	for	us	.	thus	,	the	jews	did	n't	kill	jesus	.	the	romans	did	n't	kill	jesus	.	jesus	willingly	died	for	our	sake	.	mel	humanizes	the	lord	in	a	special	way	.	and	the	scenes	between	christ	and	his	mother	are	especially	stirring	.	watch	this	movie	!	jeff	messenger	,	author	of	the	shroud	of	torrington	.
in	this	amazing	and	moving	story	,	academy	award	winner	mel	gibson	describes	the	final	twelve	hours	in	the	life	of	jesus	christ	,	from	the	last	supper	to	the	crucifixion	.	jesus	was	betrayed	by	judas	and	handed	over	to	his	enemies	,	who	condemn	him	and	sentence	him	to	die	.	he	is	brought	before	pontus	pilate	,	who	has	jesus	bound	and	flogged	.	the	flogging	scenes	are	some	of	the	most	graphic	of	the	movie	.	finally	,	pontus	pilate	agrees	to	turn	jesus	over	for	crucifixion	.	the	crucifixion	is	one	of	the	most	moving	and	powerful	segments	of	the	movie	.	seeing	jesus	crying	and	asking	god	to	forgive	his	captors	literally	brought	tears	to	my	eyes	.	jesus	also	promised	salvation	to	one	of	the	thieves	,	also	crucified	,	who	repented	of	his	sins	.	jesus'	death	was	marked	by	a	darkening	of	the	world	,	and	when	one	of	the	soldiers	was	told	to	pierce	jesus'	side	to	make	sure	he	was	dead	,	blood	and	water	poured	from	the	wound	.	jesus	was	finally	taken	down	from	the	cross	on	good	friday	and	laid	to	rest	in	the	tomb	,	but	he	was	resurrected	three	days	later	on	easter	sunday	.	this	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	and	awe	inspiring	films	i	've	ever	seen	.	director	mel	gibson	does	a	remarkable	job	describing	the	last	hours	of	jesus'	life	and	the	scenes	,	especially	the	flogging	,	cross	bearing	,	and	crucifixion	,	are	some	that	i	'll	never	forget	.	i	highly	recommend	this	powerful	and	moving	film	.	watch	and	see	how	our	savior	suffered	and	died	for	our	sins	and	won	the	ultimate	victory	with	his	resurrection	.
i	prefered	the	monty	python	movie	the	life	of	brian	on	the	same	subject	.	for	all	the	pre	release	publicity	about	the	passion	being	an	anti	jewish	movie	,	i	did	n't	think	gibson	portrayed	the	jewish	,	roman	class	of	cilizations	very	well	.	in	gibson	's	film	,	the	romans	with	the	exception	of	pilate	and	his	wife	come	off	as	sadists	.	in	real	history	,	the	romans	were	bringing	civilization	,	the	rule	of	law	,	civic	order	to	backward	,	chaotic	region	of	the	world	and	the	jewish	people	were	just	another	group	of	people	resisting	the	progress	of	roman	civilization	.	this	theme	was	presented	very	well	in	the	python	movie	the	life	of	brian	.	the	romans	considered	jesus	of	nazareth	to	be	a	very	decent	,	honest	jewish	religious	teacher	,	one	of	the	few	honest	people	in	this	backward	,	insignificant	part	of	the	roman	empire	.	was	jesus	the	real	jewish	messiah	?	in	real	history	,	the	roman	's	did	n't	really	care	too	much	,	it	was	n't	something	that	should	shake	the	entire	roman	empire	which	it	eventually	did	do	.	back	to	gibson	's	movie	.	i	found	it	to	be	almost	2	hours	of	non	stop	torture	,	what	's	the	point	?	the	one	very	good	part	was	gibson	's	depiction	of	satan	as	this	transexual	creature	always	lurking	in	the	crowd	,	lurking	in	the	mob	.	that	was	a	nice	touch	.
i	watched	this	movie	this	morning	,	i	am	physically	and	mentally	exhausted	.	this	film	was	so	powerful	and	moving	.	anytime	a	movie	is	able	to	stir	human	emotion	,	it	should	be	recognized	.	sure	,	we	all	know	the	story	,	but	it	has	never	been	delivered	with	such	power	.	the	scenery	is	great	,	the	actors	were	amazing	,	the	period	was	nicely	recreated	.	despite	religious	beliefs	,	this	film	stands	as	an	epic	.
