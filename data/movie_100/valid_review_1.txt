this	is	one	of	the	best	scrooge	movies	out	.
set	in	the	usa	about	the	time	of	the	depression	it	is	an	update	of	that	old	familiar	story	of	redemption	.
henry	winkler	played	a	great	part	as	scrooge	.
it	seems	like	just	about	everybody	has	made	a	christmas	carol	movie	.
henry	winkler	stars	in	this	remake	of	the	classic	tale	of	scrooge	.
the	title	says	it	all	this	is	a	christmas	carol	re	done	.
henry	winkler	does	an	amazing	job	as	scrooge	in	this	tale	,	he	is	an	awesome	actor	,	i	really	like	sitting	down	to	watch	this	movie	on	a	cold	night	.
trying	to	make	dickens	relevant	again	,	this	dresses	him	up	in	american	hard	times	and	values	.
henry	winkler	is	one	of	my	favorite	actors	of	all	time	.
it	did	n't	grab	our	attention	enough	to	finish	it	.
this	is	my	favorite	christmas	carol	movie	.
another	entry	in	the	retelling	of	the	classic	.
christmas	brings	at	least	a	couple	of	christmas	carol	stories	.
this	was	an	interesting	take	on	the	old	34	christmas	carol	34	movies	inspired	by	dickens	novel	.
this	wonderful	film	is	a	total	treat	on	every	level	!
this	is	a	brilliant	epic	movie	,	a	tour	de	force	,	the	best	biblical	movie	i	have	seen	with	the	exception	ofone	night	with	the	kingstarring	paul	mercurio	in	the	title	role	,	he	gives	an	intelligent	and	passionate	performance	of	a	man	who	was	prepared	to	die	,	to	keep	to	the	word	of	his	g	d	.
great	great	great	!
this	is	a	fantastic	movie	or	the	retelling	of	the	story	of	joseph	.
this	is	another	excellent	addition	to	tnt	's	bible	collection	.
joseph	is	my	favorite	movie	out	of	the	bible	collection	.
there	are	no	words	accurate	enough	to	praise	this	enthralling	television	miniseries	.
i	recommend	this	movie	,	joseph	.
this	is	a	wonderful	story	of	the	beginning	rise	of	the	nation	of	israel	.
this	is	one	of	my	most	favorite	stories	in	the	bible	,	recommend	this	one	to	anyone	who	loves	a	good	bible	story	.
this	film	is	a	recounting	of	the	genesis	tale	of	joseph	.
this	is	the	best	thanksgiving	special	around	.
have	always	loved	the	old	movies	and	this	is	the	original	frosty	the	snowman	like	i	remember	from	my	child	hood	.
we	all	know	the	song	.
a	fabulous	christmas	time	or	anytime	video	for	kids	and	adults	.
i	remember	watching	this	show	every	year	with	my	mom	.
one	of	the	best	christmas	movies	of	all	time	unique	for	it	's	time	and	still	a	favorite	of	mine	.
one	of	the	few	movies	kids	can	watch	without	mom	worrying	about	inappropriate	scenes	or	information	.
i	bought	this	for	my	2	1	2	year	old	granddaughter	.
i	did	n't	watch	this	when	i	was	young	the	way	i	did	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	and	frosty	the	snowman	except	for	maybe	once	but	it	is	a	good	story	and	i	did	get	it	this	year	.
the	story	starting	off	with	a	newsreel	on	the	children	of	the	world	preparing	for	a	visit	from	santa	claus	,	we	meet	a	mailman	named	special	delivery	kluger	.
if	you	like	christmas	movies	besides	the	nightmare	before	christmas	,	you	should	add	this	one	to	your	collection	.
i	had	to	purchase	this	dvd	.
first	televised	on	nbc	tv	on	sunday	,	december	6	,	1964	(	but	usually	associated	with	cbs	tv	due	to	that	network	's	many	airings	of	the	program	throughout	the	succeeding	years	)	,	the	animated	color	tv	special	34	rudolph	,	the	red	nosed	reindeer	34	has	now	turned	forty	years	of	age	(	as	of	this	writing	)	,	and	has	endured	for	all	those	years	as	an	annual	staple	in	many	american	homes	.
loved	this	movie	as	a	child	and	still	enjoy	it	.
there	is	only	one	rudolph	and	rankin	bass	have	done	a	superb	job	capturing	this	great	story	.
a	classic	movie	!
burl	ives	,	as	sam	the	snowman	,	narrates	this	story	of	the	lovable	,	yet	north	pole	outcast	,	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	.
if	you	were	alive	when	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	debuted	as	a	christmas	television	special	back	in	'64	,	you	may	recall	being	intrigued	by	it	simply	by	dint	of	its	elaboration	of	the	events	potrayed	in	gene	autry	's	well	known	song	and	in	the	various	golden	book	and	comic	book	editions	that	had	been	kicking	around	throughout	the	50s	and	early	60s	.
rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	is	an	enchanting	classic	narrated	by	burl	ives	that	kept	my	full	attention	as	a	child	and	is	still	wonderful	to	watch	.
hi	my	kids	5	,	3	,	1	years	old	saw	this	1	day	back	in	december	of	2011	.
christmas	just	would	n't	be	the	same	without	this	all	time	family	classic	.
the	mother	of	all	classic	kids	christmas	tales	,	and	this	series	just	moves	at	the	brisk	pace	of	santa	's	sleigh	on	xmas	eve	.
i	bought	a	bunch	of	these	old	holiday	classics	on	dvd	recently	after	getting	tired	of	missing	their	tv	air	times	each	year	.
when	a	televised	special	like	this	one	continues	to	capture	the	hearts	of	children	(	and	their	nostalgic	parents	)	year	after	year	since	1964	,	it	must	portray	an	aura	of	timelessness	in	order	to	have	such	a	long	shelf	life	.
wow	!
as	a	devoted	julia	child	fan	i	am	very	impressed	with	this	dvd	of	ms	.
i	have	always	loved	julia	child	and	have	learned	so	much	from	watching	her	shows	and	reading	her	cookbooks	.
wonderful	movie	and	a	must	see	!
the	passion	of	the	christ	is	a	film	i	doubt	will	ever	be	shown	on	television	as	an	easter	holidays	special	.
this	depiction	of	jesus'	last	hours	raises	eternal	questions	,	and	stirs	the	emotions	and	the	intellect	.
finally	,	mel	gibson	's	controversial	movie	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	arrives	on	dvd	.
.
the	man	would	make	history	.
ah	,	finally	!
a	few	observations	(	without	spoilers	)	i	finally	saw	this	movie	when	it	was	released	on	home	video	.
i	went	to	see	what	all	the	hype	was	about	.
problem	1	people	who	take	on	side	immediately	,	only	because	they	want	to	feel	connected	to	the	mass	pop	culture	audience	.
mel	gibson	is	an	ok	actor	but	his	real	talent	is	directing	and	movies	like	the	passion	of	christ	or	apocalypto	prove	it	.
it	was	well	made	,	and	the	actors	were	superb	.
so	many	well	meaning	christians	have	found	something	to	like	about	this	film	that	i	,	a	lifelong	film	buff	but	also	a	christian	,	hesitate	to	express	my	views	.
i	decided	to	give	this	film	3	stars	,	exactly	in	the	middle	of	the	rating	system	,	because	there	were	scenes	of	great	beauty	and	insight	and	then	there	were	scenes	of	torture	that	were	excessive	and	made	me	question	the	motives	of	the	film	makers	.
first	i	would	like	to	say	thank	you	to	mel	gibson	.
up	to	this	point	,	i	considered	1993	's	schindler	's	list	the	ultimate	in	cinematic	emotional	drain	.
this	is	a	film	about	subjects	most	people	would	rather	avoid	.
whenever	i	think	about	what	our	lord	suffered	,	i	remember	why	i	am	a	christian	.
purely	from	the	point	of	view	of	watching	the	movie	it	was	amazing	.
after	reading	the	(	majority	)	of	glowing	reviews	here	,	and	read	,	and	heard	the	hype	,	i	was	needless	to	say	expecting	an	experience	when	i	finally	saw	this	movie	(	.	)
i'm	sitting	here	a	day	after	having	viewed	the	movie	,	and	i'm	still	trying	to	decide	how	best	to	describe	it	.
in	my	attempt	to	compose	some	semblance	of	thoughts	about	mel	gibson	's	new	film	the	passion	of	christ	.
directors	mel	gibson	and	michael	moore	(	fahrenheit	9	11	)	stirred	controversy	in	2004	for	their	films	.
everyone	(	except	very	young	children	)	should	see	this	movie	.
mel	gibson	's	epic	masterpiece	is	the	feel	good	hit	of	the	summer	!
the	first	point	i	would	like	to	make	is	that	anyone	that	viewed	this	film	is	responsible	for	the	message	contained	in	it	.
not	to	mention	his	father	is	a	rabid	antisemite	.
i	love	this	movie	.
a	respectfully	done	version	of	the	life	and	ministry	of	the	only	son	of	god	,	our	lord	and	savior	jesus	christ	.
the	absolute	best	movie	about	jesus	christ	,	movie	in	general	ever	to	be	made	.
mel	gibson	's	film	about	the	trasgression	of	jesus	christ	's	life	is	vividly	portrayed	in	this	film	.
the	only	thing	i	regret	is	not	having	held	the	purchase	of	this	film	until	this	definite	edition	came	along	which	,	judging	by	the	bare	boneness	of	the	previous	one	,	was	very	much	a	fact	.
i	have	never	seen	a	movie	which	shows	the	true	suffering	of	christ	before	during	and	after	the	cruicifiction	.
i	was	one	of	those	who	was	surprised	by	the	extensive	critiques	of	the	film	as	anti	jewish	.
i	knew	the	story	already	,	and	i	have	seen	probably	all	the	classic	passion	movies	.
powerful	emotional	great	acting	amazingplot	background	history	of	jesus	is	assumed	u	.
it	disturbs	me	that	so	many	people	like	this	movie	as	much	as	they	do	.
passion	of	the	christ	is	a	must	have	dvd	(	or	video	)	it	is	horrifying	,	graphic	,	detailed	and	yet	enlightening	.
i	normally	do	n't	write	reviews	of	movies	since	i	do	n't	go	to	see	many	of	them	because	they	are	usually	such	nonsensical	hollywood	crap	.
this	is	a	movie	i	have	avoided	watching	until	a	few	days	ago	.
'the	passion	of	the	christ'	is	an	extremely	graphic	motion	picture	that	depicts	the	gruesome	torture	death	of	jesus	christ	.
i	saw	the	passion	of	the	christ	several	months	ago	when	it	was	first	released	in	theaters	,	however	it	's	message	of	unconditional	love	and	selfless	sacrifice	remain	indelibly	etched	in	my	mind	.
amazing	and	powerful	film	.
i	come	to	this	review	a	christian	woman	strong	in	the	faith	of	god	,	but	will	try	to	review	using	my	intellect	.
mel	gibson	's	film	is	as	beautiful	and	startling	as	a	caravagio	painting	.
in	this	amazing	and	moving	story	,	academy	award	winner	mel	gibson	describes	the	final	twelve	hours	in	the	life	of	jesus	christ	,	from	the	last	supper	to	the	crucifixion	.
i	prefered	the	monty	python	movie	the	life	of	brian	on	the	same	subject	.
i	watched	this	movie	this	morning	,	i	am	physically	and	mentally	exhausted	.
