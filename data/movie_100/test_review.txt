henry	winkler	is	very	good	in	this	twist	on	the	classic	story	.	not	a	conventional	remake	,	but	a	version	of	the	story	set	in	early	america	.	give	it	a	try	.
this	has	been	a	favorite	movie	of	mine	for	a	long	time	.	henry	winkler	is	great	as	a	modern	day	scrooge	.	there	are	many	movies	giving	a	new	twist	to	dickens	,	but	this	one	is	true	to	the	original	story	.	it	is	set	during	the	depression	.
this	is	the	american	adaptation	of	the	charles	dickens'	classic	.	it	is	interesting	that	in	the	movie	the	main	character	is	seen	ripping	the	pages	out	of	a	collector	's	item	book	of	a	christmas	carol	.	henry	winkler	gives	an	outstanding	performance	as	benedict	slade	,	a	loan	officer	who	reclaims	valued	possessions	of	those	unable	to	make	late	payments	on	christmas	eve	.	his	visit	by	the	spirits	,	the	life	in	the	orphanage	and	how	one	man	helped	him	,	leads	to	a	very	sentimental	ending	.	it	would	have	been	good	if	the	images	could	be	enhanced	for	better	viewing	.	this	originally	was	a	'made	for	tv'	program	and	is	presented	complete	with	the	fade	outs	for	the	commercial	breaks	.	david	wayne	gives	a	great	performance	as	the	book	owner	as	well	as	christmases	past	.
this	is	a	wonderful	movie	.	it	stay	faithful	to	a	christmas	carol	,	but	it	very	american	.	a	fun	movie	for	one	and	all	.
anorher	good	movie	for	holiday	watchers	.	a	little	twist	from	the	ordinary	scrooge	movie	.	enjoyable	.	what	could	n't	you	like	from	the	fons	.
i	must	confess	to	being	a	bit	of	a	coinsure	of	dickens'	classic	tale	.	i	have	many	versions	of	it	and	always	love	seeing	the	various	interpretations	offered	.	this	one	,	however	,	continues	to	be	one	of	my	all	time	favorites	.	the	change	of	setting	forces	the	film	to	explain	elements	of	the	book	that	most	films	overlook	because	they	assume	you	're	already	familiar	with	the	story	.	examples	of	this	include	how	scrooge	(	slade	in	the	film	)	could	be	so	mean	and	yet	think	himself	a	just	man	,	also	the	reason	the	ghost	of	his	dead	partner	is	miserable	(	not	understanding	the	need	to	do	good	until	he	has	lost	the	power	)	.	add	to	this	the	wonderful	performances	by	winkler	et	al	and	you	've	got	an	absolutely	classic	film	.	in	my	opinion	,	this	version	of	dickens'	story	is	closer	to	the	original	spirit	of	his	work	than	many	less	derivative	versions	.	the	material	is	handled	with	reverence	and	respect	and	it	shows	,	the	settings	and	characters	are	well	conceived	,	and	the	look	of	the	film	is	faithful	to	the	period	.	all	in	all	an	excellent	holiday	piece	well	worth	the	money	.
most	of	us	remember	henry	winkler	in	the	role	of	arthur	the	fonz	fonzarelli	on	happy	days	.	i	took	a	chance	on	this	.	he	's	an	even	better	actor	than	i	remember	.	the	story	is	set	during	the	depression	.	henry	's	character	reposesses	furniture	rented	from	him	by	various	poor	families	.	instead	of	ghosts	,	he	has	visions	involving	the	people	he	's	left	destitute	.	not	sappy	like	some	christmas	carol	renditions	are	.	i	was	favorably	impressed	by	the	story	as	well	as	the	acting	.	gerard	parks	(	doc	from	fraggle	rock	)	was	also	in	it	,	as	was	a	young	dorian	harewood	.	a	nice	addition	to	my	christmas	carol	collection	.
he	did	a	great	job	as	a	scrooge	type	character	.	i	truly	enjoyed	this	film	.	i	liked	him	from	the	happy	days	show	.
henry	winkler	does	a	great	acting	job	as	he	protrays	34	mr	.	scrooge	.	34	here	again	one	the	whole	family	can	enjoy	!
henry	winkler	is	the	one	of	the	best	scrooge	i	've	seen	!	we	see	a	lot	of	scrooge	movies	this	was	a	breath	of	fresh	air	.
not	the	best	quality	dvd	,	but	it	's	a	great	story	.	i	recommend	it	to	all	.
very	well	done	,	henry	winkler	is	a	smooth	guy	.	close	to	the	original	story	line	,	so	is	fun	to	watch	from	an	american	perspective	.
it	is	pretty	much	the	traditional	scrooge	story	,	but	set	in	america	in	about	1880	.	it	does	give	a	twist	to	it	to	help	americans	tie	the	story	into	a	scene	in	their	history	.
though	this	interpretation	of	joseph	's	life	has	been	substantially	embellished	,	the	heart	and	soul	of	the	story	remain	intact	,	and	is	ultimately	quite	faithful	to	the	biblical	account	covered	in	genesis	ch	.	33	18	through	ch	.	46	30	.	much	of	the	acting	is	marvelous	,	especially	ben	kingsley	as	potiphar	,	whose	part	has	thankfully	been	enlarged	,	because	he	is	riveting	in	every	scene	he	is	in	.	martin	landau	is	also	excellent	as	the	patriarch	jacob	,	who	mourns	the	apparent	loss	of	his	favorite	son	,	joseph	.	australian	actor	dancer	paul	mercurio	(	quot	strictly	ballroom	quot	)	is	good	in	the	lead	,	and	others	in	the	cast	include	leslie	ann	warren	as	potiphar	's	lying	wife	,	the	always	beautiful	dominique	sanda	as	leah	,	and	some	fine	character	actors	playing	joseph	's	brothers	,	notably	michael	attwell	(	judah	)	,	and	vincenzo	nicoli	(	simeon	)	.	included	in	this	film	,	and	intrinsic	to	joseph	's	life	are	the	stories	of	tamar	and	judah	,	and	the	horrific	tale	his	sister	dinah	,	both	done	effectively	.	the	only	parts	that	are	less	than	first	rate	are	the	scenes	in	pharoah	's	court	almost	campy	in	costuming	and	acting	,	they	can	provide	some	amusement	in	the	midst	of	all	the	drama	.	stefano	dionisi	is	a	most	unlikely	and	modern	looking	pharoah	,	and	has	the	ultimate	babe	for	a	wife	,	the	pulchritudinous	monica	bellucci	.	the	entire	film	though	,	is	always	mentally	and	visually	entertaining	,	and	has	much	spiritual	content	.	as	with	so	much	of	the	old	testament	,	there	are	allegories	that	run	through	its	narrative	that	point	to	the	new	testament	,	and	the	story	of	joseph	has	much	of	this	symbolism	.	filmed	in	quarzazate	,	morocco	,	with	its	exotic	ancient	structures	and	landscapes	,	the	cinematography	by	rafaele	mertes	is	wonderful	this	is	a	way	above	average	production	for	television	,	and	a	film	about	a	man	who	quot	does	nothing	against	his	conscience	even	on	pain	of	death	quot	is	worth	watching	again	and	again	.
a	movie	never	presents	a	story	exactly	as	you	envisioned	it	,	but	nevertheless	,	every	movie	version	you	see	gives	you	new	insights	into	the	story	.	this	is	a	very	biblically	accurate	version	of	the	joseph	story	,	not	changing	the	biblical	story	but	rather	developing	it	.	(	for	example	,	in	this	version	,	potiphar	believes	joseph	is	innocent	of	immorality	with	his	wife	,	and	joseph	tells	him	about	his	past	as	a	flashback	,	not	found	in	the	bible	.	)	the	massacre	at	shechem	in	genesis	34	is	included	and	shows	what	rotten	people	some	of	joseph	's	brothers	were	.	the	actors	for	the	brothers	do	very	well	demonstrating	individuality	but	also	a	group	mentality	,	and	they	show	powerful	character	change	by	the	end	.	it	's	interesting	that	the	movie	shows	the	brothers	have	really	changed	just	by	showing	their	eager	attitude	in	blessing	the	name	of	god	with	their	father	jacob	(	blessed	be	his	name	)	!	the	actor	for	jacob	does	very	well	,	too	.	(	the	actor	for	joseph	is	fine	,	too	,	but	the	character	could	n't	have	too	much	personality	,	because	every	viewer	has	a	preconceived	expectation	of	what	he	should	be	like	.	)	the	movie	introduced	me	to	an	interesting	idea	,	which	is	that	jacob	may	have	been	involved	in	preserving	genealogies	and	stories	from	abraham	.	the	book	of	genesis	does	have	a	much	more	continuous	account	of	jacob	's	life	,	whereas	stories	of	abraham	's	life	are	like	disconnected	snapshots	.	so	what	i	got	most	out	of	this	movie	was	the	interesting	idea	that	the	book	of	genesis	was	recorded	before	moses'	time	.
if	it	were	n't	for	the	seduction	scene	with	potiphar	's	wife	,	this	movie	would	have	been	excellent	.	that	scene	was	so	sensual	that	it	was	borderline	r	rated	in	our	book	.	i	almost	shut	it	off	at	that	scene	.	before	the	actual	biblical	account	of	jospeh	running	off	,	leaving	his	garment	behind	him	,	there	is	a	scene	in	which	potiphar	's	wife	joins	him	in	a	bathing	room	and	(	while	he	is	in	a	pool	)	clearly	and	very	erotically	reaches	her	hands	under	the	water	and	strokes	his	private	parts	.	he	does	n't	flee	that	time	!	this	scene	ruined	the	movie	for	us	,	and	though	we	've	enjoyed	other	movies	from	this	series	,	we	could	n't	keep	this	movie	because	of	that	one	scene	.	too	bad	!
i	thought	the	movie	was	sufficiently	close	to	the	bible	story	.	the	sets	were	often	lacking	,	but	i	enjoyed	the	movie	anyway	.	i	had	a	copy	that	i	bought	with	the	bible	collection	7	or	8	years	ago	that	i	loaned	out	and	never	got	back	.	i	was	happy	to	get	this	at	around	7	.	i	recommend	the	bible	collection	highly	.
this	is	my	go	to	movie	for	when	i	need	to	be	humble	.	this	telling	of	joseph	is	very	,	very	close	to	the	bible	,	and	that	is	what	i	was	looking	for	.	sometimes	when	you	purchase	this	movies	it	is	strictly	hollywood	version	.	this	time	they	got	it	right	.
i	really	loved	this	movie	,	it	describes	the	biblical	account	pretty	accurate	.	it	starts	w	joseph	being	sold	to	egypt	and	backtracks	after	joseph	is	accused	from	potiphars	wife	,	when	joseph	defends	himself	in	front	of	potiphar	through	telling	him	his	life	story	.	i	was	clued	to	the	screen	the	whole	time	.	also	the	actor	for	joseph	is	very	likable	and	also	jacob	(	martin	landau	)	did	a	great	performance	.
very	good	movie	.	another	great	bible	character	truly	comes	to	life	and	is	a	good	message	for	the	family	.
joseph	clearly	tells	how	god	can	use	anyone	.	despite	his	background	of	brothers	who	hated	him	and	sold	him	into	slavery	,	he	held	on	through	prison	years	in	egypt	and	became	the	second	highest	,	most	powerful	leader	in	egypt	.	when	his	brothers	finally	came	to	the	realization	that	this	leader	under	pharoah	was	indeed	their	very	own	brother	,	it	was	then	that	joseph	forgave	them	for	what	transpired	in	his	youth	.	it	's	a	lesson	we	can	all	take	to	heart	.
this	is	a	thanksgiving	tale	that	begins	with	the	ship	mayflower	being	caught	up	in	a	big	storm	.	a	churchmouse	named	william	tells	the	story	from	a	mouses	viewpoint	.	he	begins	with	the	decision	by	the	pilgrims	preacher	to	move	to	america	,	and	the	packing	of	the	mayflower	.	a	disaster	at	sea	threatens	to	sink	the	ship	,	but	william	the	pilgrim	mouse	has	an	idea	to	save	the	ship	.	the	pilgrims	land	safely	and	write	the	mayflower	compact	.	they	begin	to	build	their	new	colony	and	church	,	but	it	is	already	fall	and	they	do	not	have	enough	food	stored	.	the	winter	is	so	harsh	and	food	so	limited	that	many	pilgrims	do	not	live	through	the	winter	.	the	pilgrims	learn	to	plant	crops	in	the	spring	,	and	in	the	fall	celebrate	with	a	big	feast	,	the	first	thanksgiving	.	william	also	scuttles	a	plan	to	blame	the	indians	for	an	attack	on	the	pilgrims	.	romeo	muller	who	wrote	adapted	the	rudolph	special	and	others	wrote	this	story	.	maury	laws	who	did	such	a	good	job	with	the	music	on	the	other	specials	wrote	the	music	for	this	one	,	while	jules	bass	wrote	the	lyrics	.	the	songs	include	elbow	room	about	the	tight	conditions	on	ship	,	a	song	by	priscilla	called	when	he	looks	at	me	,	a	love	song	between	john	and	priscilla	called	time	stands	still	which	is	reprised	with	the	arrival	of	spring	.	the	pilgrims	sing	this	land	was	meant	to	be	free	,	while	they	are	full	of	hope	and	building	a	new	church	and	village	.	kids	love	this	film	,	and	it	has	a	wonderful	ending	.	this	1	hour	tv	special	originally	aired	on	nbc	on	november	23	,	1968	.	it	is	done	in	traditional	cel	animation	.	the	tale	is	narrated	and	sung	by	tennessee	ernie	ford	,	captain	standish	is	voiced	by	eddie	albert	,	priscilla	is	voiced	by	joanie	summers	(	yes	,	of	happy	days	)	.	four	different	characters	are	are	performed	by	the	famous	voice	artist	paul	frees	,	including	captain	jones	,	smiling	buzzard	,	quizzler	,	and	scurv	.	this	was	produced	by	rankin	bass	studios	,	who	were	in	high	demand	due	to	the	success	of	their	1964	stop	motion	hit	,	rudolph	,	the	red	nosed	reindeer	.	after	rudolph	their	next	holiday	special	was	cricket	on	the	hearth	in	1967	,	a	traditional	cel	animated	feature	,	then	the	mouse	on	the	mayflower	the	following	year	.	in	addition	to	rudolph	the	studio	made	over	35	tv	specials	,	of	which	about	19	are	holiday	specials	.	some	of	the	others	include	year	without	a	santa	claus	,	nestor	the	long	eared	donkey	,	the	little	drummer	boy	,	frosty	the	snowman	,	santa	claus	is	coming'to	town	,	here	comes	peter	cottontail	,	cricket	on	the	hearth	,	the	stingiest	man	in	town	,	'twas	the	night	before	christmas	,	a	christmas	tree	,	pinnochio	's	christmas	,	rudolph	's	shiny	new	year	,	the	first	easter	bunny	,	the	easter	bunny	is	coming'to	town	,	leprechauns	christmas	,	the	first	christmas	,	and	frosty	's	winter	wonderland	.	they	also	made	non	holiday	films	such	as	the	hobbit	flight	of	dragons	mad	monster	party	,	the	last	unicorn	.	it	is	incredible	that	one	company	is	responsible	for	all	those	tv	specials	,	which	are	95	of	the	ones	broadcast	every	year	.	their	studio	's	work	includes	standard	animation	,	stop	motion	animagic	,	and	live	action	.	they	really	are	a	huge	part	of	our	pop	culture	history	.	i	hope	this	comes	out	on	a	restored	dvd	soon	,	i	have	bought	all	the	other	rankin	bass	that	has	been	released	on	dvd	.	the	publishing	rights	to	most	of	the	rankin	bass	catalog	of	films	is	currently	owned	by	little	golden	books	,	and	they	have	begin	the	long	and	expesive	process	of	preserving	and	restoring	the	original	films	,	and	releasing	them	on	dvd	.	they	have	done	a	great	job	with	the	other	films	,	some	that	look	as	good	as	they	did	when	they	were	made	.	they	even	restored	missing	footage	to	rudolph	.	theyhave	been	adding	extra	features	and	behind	the	scenes	featurettes	to	the	dvd	's	as	well	,	and	creating	some	very	nice	box	sets	.
for	more	about	rankin	bass	and	rudolph	,	check	out	the	books	and	blog	of	author	expert	rick	goldschmidt	,	who	helped	save	the	peppermint	mine	scene	.	frosty	the	snowman	came	along	in	1968	,	when	the	small	new	york	based	rankin	bass	production	company	was	proving	itself	in	a	marketplace	dominated	by	hollywood	animation	giants	with	saturday	morning	series	(	king	kong	)	,	feature	films	(	the	daydreamer	,	mad	monster	party	)	and	other	specials	(	cricket	on	the	hearth	)	.	like	all	of	their	weekly	series	,	frosty	was	done	in	what	is	now	called	2	d	or	cel	animation	.	almost	all	of	their	animation	was	done	in	japan	,	and	this	was	one	completed	at	mushi	studios	.	the	animation	is	n't	much	more	fluid	than	in	their	animagic	productions	,	but	it	works	very	well	even	by	today	's	standards	,	in	which	flash	is	becoming	so	prevalent	in	tv	cartoons	.	what	makes	it	stand	head	and	shoulders	over	most	specials	is	its	unerring	simplicity	,	the	voice	cast	(	led	by	jimmy	durante	,	jackie	vernon	and	billy	dewolfe	)	and	the	rich	musical	house	style	by	maury	laws	.	more	than	anything	else	,	perhaps	,	the	design	by	paul	coker	,	jr	.	comes	across	most	dramatically	in	hand	drawn	animation	and	makes	frosty	look	like	a	christmas	card	come	to	life	.	watching	the	crisp	,	linear	coker	images	(	which	resemble	his	work	for	countless	greeting	cards	and	especially	mad	magazine	)	in	blu	ray	is	a	treat	.	this	was	either	beautifully	preserved	or	painstakingly	restored	or	both	.	by	daughter	remarked	that	it	looks	like	it	was	just	made	yesterday	!	the	bonus	on	the	disc	is	frosty	returns	,	the	1992	special	cbs	commissioned	years	later	(	though	the	1974	rankin	bass	'twas	the	night	before	christmas	special	usually	held	the	ratings	in	the	second	half	hour	following	frosty	)	,	was	directed	by	peanuts	legend	bill	melendez	.	cbs	may	have	also	requested	that	the	special	resemble	a	peanuts	special	because	frosty	returns	looks	almost	identical	to	a	show	with	charlie	brown	and	snoopy	.	frosty	returns	is	notable	for	several	reasons	,	including	the	voice	of	a	very	young	elisabeth	moss	(	peggy	olsen	on	madmen	)	when	she	was	a	child	actor	,	a	witty	script	by	oliver	goldstick	and	jim	lewis	,	and	a	nice	supporting	cast	,	especially	if	you	're	a	sctv	and	saturday	night	live	fan	(	the	executive	producer	was	snl	's	lorne	michaels	,	whose	broadway	video	controlled	the	rankin	bass	video	library	at	the	time	)	.	my	only	quibble	is	that	frosty	returns	either	never	got	the	loving	care	in	the	vault	as	it	animated	predecessor	or	there	was	a	mastering	problem	,	because	there	is	a	lot	of	line	noise	throughout	,	almost	as	if	it	were	a	vhs	tape	instead	of	a	blu	ray	!	i	might	guess	that	since	this	show	is	not	the	main	attraction	,	it	did	n't	matter	as	much	,	but	you	ca	n't	miss	the	flaws	when	you	can	see	the	images	so	clearly	.	other	than	that	,	frosty	the	snowman	itself	on	blu	ray	does	indeed	look	like	it	was	made	yesterday	,	rather	than	over	40	years	ago	.	for	more	about	rankin	bass	and	frosty	,	check	out	the	books	and	blog	of	author	expert	rick	goldschmidt	,	who	helped	save	the	peppermint	mine	scene	.	note	if	you	have	the	original	dvd	of	frosty	,	you	may	want	to	hang	onto	to	it	,	though	,	because	the	blu	ray	contains	no	extras	.
i	loved	this	movie	as	a	child	and	miss	seeing	on	tv	now	days	so	i	found	it	here	and	purchased	.	if	you	like	the	classic	version	and	not	the	newbie	stuff	this	is	the	one	for	you
my	husband	and	i	watched	this	when	we	were	childen	.	my	son	and	daughter	watched	this	when	they	where	children	.	now	that	we	are	all	adults	,	we	all	still	love	to	watch	frosty	the	snowman	every	christmas	season	.	it	's	a	classic	.	they	do	n't	make	them	like	this	anymore	.
i	was	pleased	to	see	this	video	when	it	first	came	out	and	i	recommend	it	very	much	.	i	watched	it	with	my	sons	,	who	were	born	in	1965	and	1966	,	all	the	years	they	were	growing	up	.	they	are	now	fine	parents	themselves	.	i	believe	it	expresses	very	well	the	true	meaning	of	christ	mas	.	the	review	from	t	.	liptak	says	it	very	well	.	it	puts	christ	back	into	christmas	where	he	belongs	.	it	was	and	still	is	one	of	very	few	videos	that	tell	what	christmas	is	about	the	greatest	gift	of	all	to	a	sad	and	needy	world	the	gift	of	christ	,	that	's	why	we	celebrate	christ	mas	.
the	only	thing	you	can	do	is	love	this	classic	.	definately	a	movie	to	be	watched	every	year	by	the	whole	family	.	it	should	make	us	all	stop	and	realize	how	fortunate	we	are	no	matter	what	religion	you	are	.
i	gave	this	5	stars	because	it	is	an	excellent	classic	to	add	to	your	christmas	dvd	collection	for	children	both	young	and	old	!	i'm	building	our	christmas	dvd	collection	as	we	now	have	two	grandchildren	and	look	forward	to	watching	them	with	them	in	a	couple	of	years	.	i	recommend	this	to	anyone	looking	for	a	wonderful	and	warm	classic	as	the	little	drummer	boy	.
the	little	drummer	boy	deserves	a	place	alongside	rudolph	and	frosty	as	one	of	rankin	bass	's	vert	best	holiday	classics	,	and	where	it	may	lack	in	eye	candy	and	whimsy	compared	to	other	holiday	favorites	it	more	than	makes	up	for	it	with	a	truly	powerful	and	touching	story	.	now	here	's	the	sad	part	the	print	master	used	for	this	dvd	is	absolutely	horrible	,	especially	in	comparison	to	all	the	other	rankin	bass	dvds	that	have	been	released	.	i	was	shocked	to	see	a	picture	quality	that	's	inferior	to	even	vhs	recorded	in	slp	mode	.	images	are	dark	,	murky	,	and	full	of	scratches	.	i	was	even	more	shocked	to	see	credit	given	to	3	people	at	the	end	for	supposed	film	restoration	.	how	horrible	must	the	unrestored	print	have	been	to	get	it	up	to	sub	sub	par	level	?	sorry	,	but	i	do	n't	buy	it	.	this	film	deserves	to	be	restored	properly	.
loved	this	movie	as	a	child	and	my	kids	loved	this	movie	.	hope	the	grandchildren	feel	the	same	.	not	christmas	until	we	watch	this	short	movie	.
i	bought	this	for	my	grandson	.	it	was	my	favorite	christmas	time	show	and	,	sadly	,	i	have	not	seen	it	showing	on	tv	for	a	few	years	now	.	he	really	likes	it	and	watched	it	over	and	over	.
this	was	a	gift	for	my	husband	for	year	before	last	christmas	!	sorry	we	did	not	see	this	rating	page	.	i	was	so	pleased	at	the	immediate	service	,	the	new	condition	.	my	husband	was	so	happy	about	having	this	.	sincerely	,	sandy	peterson
i	could	never	remember	what	the	title	of	this	show	was	growing	up	although	i	always	loved	it	.	would	have	been	more	meaningful	to	call	it	the	santa	story	or	something	.	all	the	questions	of	the	santa	story	a	answered	here	.
i	bought	this	cause	i'm	just	feeling	very	nostalgic	this	year	.	it	was	really	wonderful	to	see	this	again	.	the	dvd	is	great	.
i	was	n't	so	thrilled	with	this	show	as	a	kid	and	i	guess	i'm	still	not	.	it	lacks	the	excitement	and	warmth	of	some	of	the	other	rankin	bass	shows	from	the	60s	.	it	's	ok	though	.
this	is	a	dvd	that	every	family	should	own	.	i	do	n't	care	how	old	i	get	,	this	movie	will	always	be	my	favorite	especially	since	fred	astaire	is	in	it	.	lol	.
as	with	frosty	the	snowman	i	heard	the	song	and	then	saw	the	tv	special	.	both	are	good	but	i	havent	seen	the	tv	spevial	in	years	.	just	like	frosty	the	snowman	though	im	sure	that	wont	be	a	problem	because	im	a	christmas	freak	.	id	reccomend	them	both	.	frosty	and	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	.	you	should	get	it	.	merry	christmas	.
as	his	stop	animation	alter	ego	,	sam	the	snowman	,	the	legendary	burl	ives	narrates	this	sweet	and	cutesy	1964	classic	about	how	a	red	nosed	reindeer	(	voiced	by	billie	mae	richard	)	,	a	toy	making	elf	who	wants	to	be	a	dentist	(	paul	soles	)	,	and	a	group	of	misfit	toys	(	voiced	by	carl	banas	and	corinne	conley	)	who	must	all	discover	their	own	niches	in	a	world	to	which	they	do	n't	easily	conform	.	watching	this	cute	production	is	an	annual	ritual	in	which	i	,	like	many	,	have	indulged	since	childhood	.	it	does	n't	seem	like	christmas	without	it	.	it	's	rather	amusing	that	in	recent	years	,	stores	have	carried	dolls	of	the	beloved	figures	,	which	should	further	promote	the	film	's	charming	legacy	.	we	follow	rudolph	from	his	birth	as	the	son	of	santa	's	(	stan	francis	)	sleigh	team	member	,	donner	(	paul	kligman	)	,	and	his	mate	(	peg	dixon	)	,	through	formative	years	where	the	long	hidden	secret	of	his	neon	nose	is	revealed	,	the	prejudice	he	faces	,	the	consolation	he	receives	from	the	reindeer	coach	's	daughter	,	clarice	(	janet	orenstein	)	,	and	the	delightful	friends	he	finds	on	his	way	to	self	discovery	,	such	as	yukon	cornelius	(	larry	d	.	mann	)	,	and	king	moonracer	.	even	the	aboninable	snowman	finds	his	purpose	in	the	course	of	this	tale	,	which	has	captured	the	hearts	,	minds	,	and	imaginations	of	children	for	45	years	,	and	whose	magic	,	brightness	and	delight	will	continue	to	do	so	for	many	more	years	to	come	!
recomendad	iacute	ssimo	!	um	cl	aacute	ssico	aqui	da	tv	brasileira	.	adorei	a	qualidade	da	imagem	.	pena	que	no	eacute	widescreen	.	i	recommend	it	!	here	's	a	classic	brazilian	tv	.	i	loved	the	image	quality	.	too	bad	it	's	not	widescreen	.
i	do	n't	know	what	some	people	were	sent	.	but	,	i	got	the	original	.	it	is	just	as	we	've	all	seen	growing	up	.	i	love	it	!
there	is	a	lot	to	like	with	this	blu	ray	which	i	just	viewed	today	.	the	details	are	awesome	and	the	colors	are	vivid	and	bright	.	i	noticed	materials	in	santa	's	clothes	when	he	visits	the	donners	cave	in	the	beginning	,	details	i	had	not	noticed	before	.	and	the	sound	is	great	as	it	is	in	dolby	digital	.	now	,	the	negative	.	when	sam	the	snowman	sings	silver	and	gold	which	is	my	absolute	favorite	song	in	this	classic	tv	special	,	one	word	is	lost	as	apparently	there	was	a	skip	in	the	old	film	elements	when	this	was	transferred	.	instead	of	singing	,	everyone	wishes	for	silver	and	gold	.	it	says	,	everyone	wishes	.	silver	and	gold	.	that	is	really	the	only	defect	i	found	but	it	was	a	bummer	.	was	there	no	way	to	simply	take	the	song	from	a	cd	(	it	has	been	released	on	cd	)	or	somehow	restore	it	a	bit	better	?	also	,	there	are	no	extras	whatsoever	.	i	found	that	to	be	a	bit	cheap	,	a	bare	bones	release	.	but	for	the	picture	quality	,	if	you	love	this	classic	christmas	special	as	i	do	,	it	is	still	very	nice	to	own	in	high	definition	.	four	out	of	five	stars	from	me	.
he	's	not	just	a	misfit	you	nitwit	!	go	rudolph	and	herbie	!
wow	this	is	a	dvd	?	!	?	the	show	is	as	it	was	in	the	tv	release	and	the	extras	do	bring	it	to	the	modern	day	but	i	think	they	(	sony	wonder	golden	books	)	could	have	packed	all	the	shows	on	one	dvd	instead	of	making	you	buy	3	of	them	.	look	to	warmer	bros	.	year	w	o	santa	claus	.	santa	claus	is	coming	to	town	and	frosty	could	have	made	it	all	in	this	dvd	.	well	i	got	it	in	the	collection	and	saved	some	over	buying	them	one	at	a	time	.	enjoy	the	show	and	worry	where	the	popcorn	money	will	come	from	later	.
this	is	a	lovely	story	for	christmas	time	made	in	a	special	animated	technique	.	i	have	watched	it	by	first	time	on	tv	when	i	was	a	child	and	i	prefere	this	kind	of	films	instead	of	the	modern	ones	that	have	a	lot	of	unnecessary	technical	resources	.	the	story	,	the	technique	and	the	music	are	superb	!	do	n't	miss	it	for	your	children	and	enjoy	it	so	much	as	i	do	.
this	is	a	christmas	cartoon	classic	.	adds	much	of	interest	to	the	rudolph	the	red	nosed	reindeer	christmas	tradition	.	has	some	parts	that	tend	to	be	edited	out	when	watched	on	television	.	a	must	have	dvd	.
it	would	n't	be	christmas	time	without	rudolph	and	santa	claus	is	coming	to	town	.	there	's	a	certain	charm	and	holiday	spirit	in	these	older	shows	that	's	been	lost	with	modern	animation	.
this	is	one	of	those	christmas	movies	that	you	ca	n't	get	through	the	holiday	season	without	seeing	at	least	once	.	the	animation	is	charming	and	the	story	a	classic	one	.	this	movie	is	a	sad	sweet	christmas	story	that	usually	makes	me	want	to	cry	.	why	could	n't	they	just	accept	rudolph	?	all	about	the	greatness	of	santa	's	most	famous	reindeer	and	how	his	unusual	abilitys	came	to	use	one	christmas	eve	you	ca	n't	help	but	love	this	small	misfit	little	reindeer	and	neither	can	santa	.	their	is	something	magical	and	charming	about	this	classic	christmas	story	that	makes	kids	believe	and	adults	wish	that	they	could	.	this	is	definately	one	of	those	christmas	movies	that	will	never	go	out	of	style	and	will	be	around	for	generations	.	definately	a	movie	that	you	should	buy	if	you	have	children	or	grandchildren	they	'll	enjoy	this	christmas	classic	as	much	as	you	will	.
this	bluray	is	an	improvement	over	the	dvd	.	the	picture	is	steady	,	and	more	importantly	,	the	soundtrack	has	been	steadied	as	well	,	eliminating	the	mistracked	,	out	of	tune	mess	of	wavering	pitch	that	plagued	vhs	and	even	earlier	dvd	copies	of	this	show	.	probably	the	best	of	the	rankin	bass	xmas	shows	from	the	60s	.
rudolph	is	a	cute	movie	.	theres	a	lot	more	to	it	than	the	song	!	watch	out	for	the	bominables	in	this	one	.	and	santa	is	a	little	skinny	at	the	beginning	!	but	happy	fun	all	the	way	.	good	for	kids	who	feel	left	out	or	different	.	good	characters	,	like	hermie	the	elf	dentist	,	clarice	,	rudolf	's	doe	,	and	of	course	,	yukon	cornelius	,	the	prospector	!	(	not	at	all	like	the	toy	story2	one	.	)	nice	family	movie	.
this	movie	is	a	tradition	in	our	house	,	so	having	the	dvd	which	is	remastered	is	great	to	have	.	finally	able	to	toss	the	old	vhs	tape	!
i	had	to	order	this	,	in	order	for	my	wife	,	and	the	others	,	on	the	chambers'	christmas	parade	float	committee	could	see	the	characters	in	the	movie	and	what	costumes	had	to	be	made	.	then	we	build	the	float	.	our	theme	is	34	the	island	of	misfit	toys	34
years	ago	,	some	friends	of	ours	sent	us	a	vhs	tape	taped	off	the	air	which	had	several	christmas	classics	including	emmet	otter	's	jug	band	christmas	,	frosty	the	snowman	,	the	grinch	,	babar	father	christmas	,	and	of	course	the	tried	and	true	rudolph	.	now	that	the	vhs	tape	is	pretty	much	worn	out	and	my	vcr	is	permanently	broke	,	i	decided	to	start	replacing	these	classics	on	dvd	.	rudolph	was	the	first	one	i	replaced	and	ever	since	then	i	've	been	addicted	to	it	every	christmas	season	.	i	look	forward	to	watching	it	all	year	long	.	the	sweet	ending	makes	me	cry	every	time	i	watch	it	.	here	is	why	i	did	not	give	this	dvd	five	stars	.	in	the	original	version	when	rudolph	and	hermey	run	away	they	sang	a	song	about	fame	and	fortune	,	which	was	the	version	i	had	.	in	the	version	i	bought	they	sang	a	song	which	was	more	or	less	recycled	called	we	're	a	couple	of	misfits	.	but	nonetheless	this	is	a	wonderful	movie	for	anybody	ages	1	to	101	.	so	no	matter	how	old	you	are	,	buy	yourself	a	copy	!	you	wo	n't	regret	it	one	bit	.
while	i	agree	that	it	would	be	great	to	have	underdog	and	friends	in	the	original	format	and	line	up	,	this	set	is	by	far	the	best	yet	of	the	caped	,	canine	crime	fighter	.	i	had	the	vhs	videos	of	underdog	and	they	were	a	mishmash	of	episodes	along	with	what	the	box	notes	called	cliff	hanger	cartoons	.	the	problem	with	cliff	hanger	cartoons	is	that	they	continue	in	multiple	episodes	or	shows	(	rocky	and	bullwinkle	followed	that	format	)	.	so	vhs	tapes	were	too	short	to	show	entire	story	arcs	.	not	so	with	these	dvds	,	which	combine	'toons	from	the	various	vhs	videos	.	because	the	art	looks	similar	,	viewers	often	mistake	underdog	for	a	jay	ward	cartoon	(	rocky	and	bullwinkle	,	george	of	the	jungle	)	,	but	it	was	made	by	total	television	.	tennessee	tuxedo	,	probably	total	's	second	most	successful	cartoon	series	(	with	don	adams	of	get	smart	and	inspector	gadget	voicing	the	scheming	penguin	,	tennessee	)	also	appears	in	the	cliff	hanger	'toons	bonus	section	of	the	dvd	.	at	one	point	total	joined	with	leonardo	productions	to	package	their	cartoons	together	for	syndication	,	so	you	also	get	the	rare	king	leonardo	show	with	odie	coloney	,	biggy	rat	and	itchy	brother	,	commander	mcbragg	and	the	hunter	.	three	dvds	were	produced	in	this	series	,	and	this	is	a	great	deal	with	all	three	in	a	box	set	.	they	include	some	of	the	best	episodes	like	the	multi	part	great	zot	,	presented	in	its	entirety	.	underdog	featured	a	narrator	and	great	voice	actors	,	including	wally	cox	as	humble	,	loveable	shoeshine	boy	aka	underdog	.	simon	bar	sinsister	serves	up	an	endless	parade	of	diabolical	devices	,	along	with	other	aptly	named	villains	like	riff	raff	.	an	all	time	classic	and	regardless	of	its	deviations	from	the	tv	format	,	well	worth	owning	.
when	i	was	just	a	little	boy	,	my	heart	was	filled	with	glee	whenever	my	friend	underdog	appeared	on	my	tv	.	from	lovable	,	humble	shoeshine	boy	to	dynamic	flying	hound	,	no	better	television	show	for	childhood	could	be	found	.	now	that	i	am	older	,	i	find	(	oh	happy	glee	)	that	underdog	can	once	again	be	seen	on	my	tv	.	this	collector	's	set	edition	,	so	carefully	restored	,	can	once	again	be	purchased	,	to	view	or	just	to	hoard	.	but	i	have	a	niece	and	nephew	,	ages	four	and	six	,	just	about	the	age	to	love	this	canine	's	cartoon	tricks	.	i	think	that	they	will	be	amazed	and	find	it	quite	sublime	to	make	friends	with	an	underdog	who	lyrically	fights	crime	.	so	let	's	lift	a	toast	to	underdog	,	a	hero	for	all	time	,	and	i	hope	you	will	forgive	me	for	reviewing	this	in	rhyme	.
underdog	was	one	of	my	all	time	favorite	cartoons	back	in	the	day	,	and	this	dvd	trio	has	a	nice	sampler	of	the	canine	crusader	's	finest	.	from	the	three	eyed	aliens	on	planet	zot	to	the	metal	munching	cloud	men	in	silver	thieves	and	,	of	course	,	regular	bad	guys	simon	bar	sinister	and	riff	raff	,	nothing	ever	beats	underdog	i	am	the	hero	who	never	fails	i	cannot	be	bothered	with	those	details	!	kids	who	appreciate	a	tongue	in	cheek	superhero	will	love	underdog	,	and	adults	will	go	for	the	jay	ward	style	humor	and	animation	(	with	that	pleasantly	crude	look	courtesy	of	the	mexican	bullwinkle	artists	)	.	eight	underdog	episodes	shown	as	full	15	minute	segments	,	not	the	original	four	part	format	are	paired	with	mini	adventures	and	the	oft	forgotten	supporting	shorts	from	the	unsung	total	tv	stable	.	of	these	,	i	loved	both	tennessee	tuxedo	with	don	adams	as	the	plucky	penguin	and	larry	storch	as	absent	minded	professor	p	.	j	.	whoopee	,	plus	quick	and	witty	science	history	lessons	to	boot	and	go	go	gophers	,	a	neat	little	western	spoof	with	the	two	brave	braves	,	ruffled	feathers	(	he	's	the	one	who	talks	in	whoops	)	and	running	board	,	as	the	un	pc	indian	heroes	.	(	was	this	the	inspiration	for	f	troop	?	)	presented	in	surprisingly	good	color	,	with	a	great	cast	of	new	york	accented	voices	including	adams	,	storch	,	wally	cox	(	of	course	)	and	allen	swift	(	check	out	his	jimmy	durante	voice	on	king	zot	!	)	,	and	featuring	the	most	rousing	theme	song	in	cartoon	history	,	you	'll	learn	why	i	've	had	an	underdog	magnet	on	my	fridge	for	20	years	.	this	is	classic	guilty	pleasure	stuff	for	big	and	little	kids	alike	it	's	a	bird	it	's	a	plane	it	's	a	frog	!	(	a	frog	?	)	not	plane	,	not	bird	,	nor	even	frog	it	's	just	little	ol'	me	(	crashes	into	airplane	)	.	underdog	!
julia	is	delightful	,	as	always	.	however	,	the	cooking	here	is	very	basic	and	rather	repetitive	.	in	the	meat	section	,	you	learn	how	to	pan	fry	a	steak	and	how	to	deglaze	the	pan	and	make	a	sauce	.	then	you	have	essentially	the	same	thing	for	a	pork	chop	and	a	veal	cutlet	.	you	learn	how	to	make	a	pot	roast	,	followed	by	the	same	instructions	but	with	chunks	of	meat	to	make	beef	stew	.	in	the	vegetable	section	,	you	learn	how	to	boil	various	vegetables	and	finish	them	off	with	a	dab	of	butter	.	very	basic	.	lots	of	butter	,	heavy	cream	,	and	wine	or	vermouth	added	to	almost	every	dish	.	the	videography	is	not	very	well	lit	for	close	ups	,	so	some	of	the	food	looks	rather	unappealing	.	i	think	this	would	be	useful	for	someone	who	wants	to	cook	basic	american	food	and	only	knows	how	to	microwave	.	but	if	you	are	already	buying	fresh	ingredients	and	putting	meals	on	the	table	,	this	will	not	really	teach	you	much	.

i	suspect	that	most	christians	already	owned	a	copy	of	mel	gibson	's	the	passion	of	the	christ	.	in	my	case	,	i	owned	the	widescreen	edition	.	if	you	do	n't	own	a	copy	stop	reading	right	now	,	and	buy	this	dvd	!	if	you	do	own	a	copy	,	you	're	probably	wondering	what	's	new	in	this	re	release	.	mel	gibson	's	2004	blockbuster	is	at	the	same	time	part	documentary	and	part	(	very	personal	)	artistic	meditation	of	the	passion	the	suffering	and	death	of	our	lord	jesus	christ	.	it	is	perhaps	one	of	the	most	moving	films	ever	made	and	one	of	the	most	important	films	for	evangelism	in	today	's	secularist	culture	of	death	.	three	years	after	its	release	(	which	,	like	the	gospels	themselves	,	was	a	source	of	heated	debate	and	division	)	,	it	has	been	re	released	as	a	definitive	edition	,	with	a	number	of	special	features	the	movie	is	still	in	aramaic	and	latin	,	with	subtitles	.	the	purpose	of	this	is	to	avoid	bringing	jesus	into	today	's	world	and	rather	force	the	viewer	back	in	time	,	as	if	you	were	a	witness	to	the	actual	events	.	disc	1	has	both	the	theatrical	and	re	cut	version	of	the	film	,	complete	with	accompanying	commentaries	by	filmmakers	,	cinematographers	,	producers	,	musical	directors	and	theologians	.	a	particularly	wonderful	feature	is	an	enhanced	viewing	mode	featuring	biblical	footnotes	while	the	movie	is	playing	.	disc	2	features	one	reasonably	in	depth	behind	the	scenes	making	of	documentary	.	the	other	features	on	this	disc	include	mini	featurettes	on	religious	art	,	ancient	languages	,	a	short	showcase	of	the	actual	places	in	jerusalem	where	the	stations	of	the	cross	occurred	,	production	art	,	a	couple	of	deleted	scenes	,	and	a	few	other	things	like	actors'	bios	and	(	disappointingly	short	)	lives	of	the	saints	.	personally	,	i	found	the	discussion	regarding	ancient	languages	most	interesting	.	fr	.	fulco	,	who	served	as	historical	and	ancient	language	consultant	during	the	scripting	,	shooting	and	post	production	of	the	film	,	is	erudite	and	well	spoken	.	the	section	on	religious	art	was	quite	engaging	,	but	a	bit	disappointing	in	its	superficiality	(	perhaps	because	i	have	a	particular	interest	in	art	history	and	love	the	details	)	.	it	would	have	been	nice	,	for	example	,	if	the	names	of	artists	and	some	details	of	the	pieces	accompanied	the	art	documentary	and	the	art	gallery	.	however	,	in	exchange	,	the	dvd	gives	a	great	mini	documentary	on	crucifixion	as	a	mode	of	punishment	and	execution	.	as	far	as	the	behind	the	scenes	features	,	most	touching	were	jim	caviezel	's	humble	and	soft	spoken	interview	,	during	which	he	(	and	others	)	describes	the	physical	,	mental	and	spiritual	anguish	he	was	made	to	endure	during	the	making	of	this	movie	which	include	,	but	are	not	limited	to	,	eight	hour	makeup	sessions	,	itching	,	migraine	headaches	,	freezing	weather	(	while	in	a	loin	cloth	)	,	being	whipped	for	real	,	having	the	several	hundred	pound	cross	fall	on	him	and	crush	his	skull	,	and	being	struck	by	lightning	.	over	these	past	three	years	,	i	have	often	wondered	(	with	great	frustration	)	why	they	did	n't	include	extras	on	the	dvd	release	of	the	passion	of	the	christ	.	perhaps	the	reason	was	that	they	did	not	want	people	to	view	this	as	a	regular	movie	,	concentrating	on	how	it	was	made	,	etc	.	rather	,	they	wanted	people	to	take	the	movie	as	it	was	and	concentrate	on	the	message	and	the	emotional	spiritual	impact	that	it	had	on	them	,	as	viewers	.	whether	catholic	christian	,	jewish	,	agnostic	or	atheist	,	it	is	sure	to	have	profound	impact	on	the	very	fiber	of	every	human	being	.	this	re	release	comes	at	a	good	time	just	when	the	movie	is	starting	to	fade	from	people	's	minds	.	the	strong	impact	that	it	had	three	years	ago	is	starting	to	taper	out	,	and	people	are	settling	back	into	their	fast	paced	modern	lives	,	which	too	often	results	in	a	distilling	of	religious	convictions	and	a	laxity	of	spiritual	fervor	.	well	,	lent	is	around	the	corner	(	february	21	,	2007	)	,	and	this	movie	makes	a	wonderful	accompaniment	to	spiritual	preparation	during	this	time	.	for	those	who	have	never	seen	the	movie	,	now	is	the	time	.	for	those	who	have	seen	it	,	but	do	n't	particularly	care	to	see	it	again	the	extras	may	give	you	a	new	appreciation	for	the	film	and	spark	a	sudden	desire	to	watch	it	over	again	.	this	may	move	you	to	meditate	on	its	scenes	,	pray	and	feel	closer	to	god	.	and	that	is	a	very	good	thing	.
as	anyone	can	see	just	from	the	comments	,	jesus	is	the	still	most	important	person	ever	to	live	on	earth	.	the	heart	of	the	matter	,	who	is	jesus	?	he	offended	the	important	because	he	sojorned	with	the	lowly	.	he	spoke	hope	to	those	who	would	hear	.	his	message	resounds	even	today	as	many	celebrate	his	birth	,	although	the	noise	floor	of	modern	life	and	media	would	drown	it	out	.	mankind	's	wholesale	will	to	err	and	inability	to	adhere	to	moral	or	ethical	standards	does	n't	invalidate	the	standard	.	the	message	jesus	brought	is	certified	by	our	very	nature	to	sin	.	our	own	efforts	to	be	moral	from	any	cuiltural	or	religious	perspective	would	eventually	lead	to	hatred	of	jesus	.	as	seen	in	the	film	,	among	the	motives	the	sanhedrin	had	to	kill	jesus	was	fulfill	a	commandment	to	execute	a	blasphemer	.	no	film	until	the	passion	of	the	christ	had	shown	how	jesus	was	marred	more	than	any	man	.	the	deliberate	depiction	of	the	process	of	his	execution	shows	that	god	loves	us	enough	to	send	his	own	son	to	die	a	cruel	death	that	we	might	be	saved	.	anyone	who	understands	jesus'	mission	and	still	is	not	moved	by	this	film	is	truly	numb	in	heart	.	the	gift	jesus	brought	us	was	rejected	yet	not	taken	back	.	we	can	still	have	what	jesus	bought	for	us	with	his	death	.	who	else	can	love	like	that	?	we	need	the	savior	,	now	more	than	ever	.
well	this	is	one	of	the	best	gore	movies	i	have	ever	seen	.	pretty	much	that	is	what	this	movie	is	.	2	hours	of	a	man	being	beaten	and	tortured	.	ranks	up	there	with	texas	chainsaw	massacre	2	and	any	romero	film	.	i	actually	was	laughing	near	the	end	of	it	because	of	how	over	the	top	this	movie	is	.	how	anyone	can	get	a	religious	experience	out	of	this	is	beyond	me	.	not	to	mention	how	hypocritical	the	religious	nuts	are	to	say	they	condemn	violence	yet	they	love	this	movie	.	well	if	you	are	a	horror	film	fan	who	appreciates	good	make	up	and	gore	then	this	ranks	up	there	with	some	of	the	best	.	who	would	have	thunk	that	mel	gibson	would	make	one	the	goriest	violent	films	of	all	time	that	would	appeal	to	two	different	groups	.	as	far	as	content	goes	and	story	line	,	this	is	not	the	movie	for	you	.	there	is	nothing	of	substance	here	,	nope	just	two	hours	of	beatings	and	torture	.
i	was	hoping	for	more	.	it	was	in	a	foreign	language	.	i	could	hot	follow	it	.	i	could	not	even	watch	the	whole	thing	,	had	to	delete	it	.
i	love	this	movie	evertime	i	watch	this	movie	i	still	cry	the	soundtrack	to	the	movie	was	so	so	but	the	music	work	better	in	the	movie	then	on	the	soundtrack	i	think	anyway	.
the	truth	as	i	know	it	,	i	cry	everytime	i	watch	this	movie	,	great	doing	business	with	saler	,	was	fast	.
assuming	you	know	the	story	(	and	one	hopes	most	of	us	do	)	i	felt	you	had	to	be	neither	religiously	inclined	,	or	interested	in	historical	theology	to	take	a	lot	away	with	you	after	seeing	this	picture	.	heavily	criticized	for	it	's	brutal	depiction	of	the	last	12	hours	of	the	life	of	christ	,	and	maligned	by	some	for	encouraging	anti	semetism	,	i	found	it	powerful	and	very	moving	,	if	disturbing	.	it	is	a	testament	to	mel	gibson	's	vision	,	and	perseverance	that	no	major	hollywood	studio	picked	up	this	picture	,	which	was	self	funded	by	mr	gibson	at	a	cost	of	around	30	million	.	the	fact	that	the	dialogue	is	chiefly	aramaic	(	the	movie	is	subtitled	throughout	)	could	also	be	seen	as	enough	to	discourage	a	lot	of	viewers	,	but	there	is	no	doubt	that	this	is	powerful	film	making	at	it	's	best	.	perhaps	enjoy	is	the	wrong	word	to	use	in	how	i	felt	after	the	movie	which	is	violent	and	unforgiving	in	showing	christ	's	persecution	and	eventual	execution	on	the	cross	,	but	it	is	compelling	,	absorbing	and	emotionally	charged	.	the	success	of	the	picture	(	i	feel	)	lies	in	the	what	has	been	the	chief	subject	of	critisicm	,	the	blow	by	blow	punishment	and	torture	the	viewer	cannot	help	but	share	with	the	main	character	.	however	,	perhaps	this	is	the	strength	of	the	movie	,	and	i	believe	gibson	's	aim	,	in	showing	what	has	always	been	hinted	at	,	or	happened	off	screen	in	other	films	of	the	genre	.	put	simply	,	it	is	saying	that	knowing	or	saying	that	christ	suffered	and	died	for	our	sins	is	not	enough	,	this	is	how	,	and	why	,	open	,	graphic	and	painful	.	not	a	movie	i	would	recommend	for	the	squeamish	or	sensitive	,	and	certainly	not	for	children	(	of	any	age	)	.	james	caveziel	is	believable	and	strong	in	the	lead	role	,	and	more	than	ably	supported	by	a	cast	of	almost	unknowns	.	top	marks	all	round	,	a	film	that	will	live	in	the	memory	long	after	you	have	seen	it	.	go	see	it	for	yourself	,	you	may	found	out	a	lot	you	did	n't	know
i	watch	this	either	on	good	friday	or	holy	saturday	to	remind	myself	of	christ	and	the	passion	.	i	find	it	bloody	as	well	as	breath	taking	.	it	is	so	intense	that	i	always	get	a	head	ache	.	having	spent	over	10	years	in	spain	and	being	an	observer	of	semana	santa	and	the	processions	in	sevilla	,	this	film	always	takes	me	back	to	the	week	starting	with	palm	sunday	and	ending	with	easter	.	most	highly	recommended	.
'the	passion	of	the	christ'	is	probably	one	of	the	most	precise	,	finely	crafted	films	in	terms	of	both	presentation	and	implementation	.	one	cannot	easily	judge	such	a	film	just	by	taking	a	glimpse	of	its	trailers	or	just	gazing	at	the	film	posters	or	wallpapers	,	its	only	after	you	get	completely	lost	in	the	film	,	you	can	feel	it	.	speaking	of	the	performances	,	jim	caviezel	as	jesus	is	beyond	the	word	excellent	,	very	precise	in	potraying	probably	the	most	difficult	historical	figure	in	the	history	of	cinema	.	along	with	caviezel	,	we	are	rewarded	with	outstanding	performances	from	maia	morgenstern	and	monica	bellucci	who	keep	you	engaged	throughout	the	film	and	at	the	same	time	giving	more	life	to	the	film	.	the	rest	of	the	cast	is	superb	and	not	a	single	flaw	can	be	found	in	the	entire	scenario	.	the	film	easily	takes	you	along	with	it	to	the	last	hours	of	jesus	,	making	you	digest	every	possible	detail	during	his	end	hours	.	one	of	the	most	important	and	rare	gems	of	cinema	and	the	last	but	not	the	least	person	to	be	applauded	is	mel	gibson	for	making	this	film	unforgettable	for	years	.
gibson	created	something	of	enduring	magnificence	.	he	did	it	with	intense	focus	,	and	total	commitment	.	the	refusal	of	much	of	the	intelligensia	to	engage	in	responsible	dialogue	about	this	film	revealed	immense	hypocracy	and	cynicism	.	the	violence	is	not	a	legitimate	issue	.	prime	time	television	with	it	crime	show	obsessions	centered	on	killing	children	is	so	much	more	truly	violent	as	to	make	public	discussions	of	the	cruelty	in	the	passion	of	the	christ	ridiculous	.	the	passion	achieves	a	near	impossible	goal	the	accurate	dipiction	of	a	first	century	execution	and	an	embracing	vision	of	the	moment	that	changed	the	history	of	the	western	world	,	as	remembered	by	those	who	insist	upon	that	event	's	unchanging	religious	significance	.	whatever	your	beliefs	,	or	lack	of	beliefs	,	it	's	worth	your	respect	and	attention	.	it	's	absurd	to	think	children	will	be	harmed	by	this	movie	when	network	television	spews	lurid	stories	of	kidnapping	,	maiming	,	rape	,	and	murder	into	our	homes	every	night	.	the	film	has	set	a	new	and	very	high	standard	for	religious	films	and	identified	a	huge	audience	that	hungers	for	spiritual	content	in	media	.
few	films	have	been	as	highly	touted	or	as	deeply	vilified	as	the	passion	of	the	christ	,	and	for	good	reason	.	in	america	and	the	world	today	,	the	divide	between	those	who	have	taken	upon	themselves	the	name	of	christ	and	those	who	have	n't	has	never	been	clearer	.	to	believers	,	the	passion	is	a	painful	but	ultimately	moving	depiction	of	the	suffering	,	death	and	resurrection	of	their	savior	.	to	non	believers	,	it	is	a	violent	portrayal	of	a	mythical	event	.	the	film	itself	is	well	made	.	as	remarked	previously	,	the	subtitles	are	not	distracting	in	the	least	.	most	viewers	are	familiar	enough	with	the	story	to	figure	out	who	mary	is	and	who	pontius	pilate	is	.	the	cinematography	is	beautiful	in	most	places	and	the	film	does	n't	drag	on	.	theologically	,	i	found	the	film	utterly	lacking	in	anti	semitism	and	a	bit	overly	catholic	(	esp	.	in	relation	to	mary	)	,	but	gibson	is	a	devout	catholic	and	this	was	his	dime	,	so	i	was	able	to	move	past	that	.	the	extra	biblical	material	did	not	detract	significantly	from	the	gospel	accounts	to	the	point	of	concern	.	that	leads	to	the	much	discussed	and	maligned	violence	of	the	film	.	it	makes	sense	that	the	new	testament	goes	into	little	detail	regarding	the	actual	crucifixion	and	scourging	.	no	one	of	that	time	needed	a	description	as	they	likely	had	seen	it	first	hand	on	many	occasions	.	the	reader	of	that	time	knew	all	too	well	the	horrors	inflicted	by	scourging	and	the	agonizing	death	on	a	cross	.	to	the	genteel	viewers	of	today	,	accustomed	to	stylized	violence	and	gore	being	fed	to	them	via	cgi	,	it	was	absolutely	necessary	to	show	the	up	close	and	personal	violence	,	inflicted	by	one	person	upon	another	,	to	really	understand	the	pain	that	christ	suffered	on	our	behalf	.	i	doubt	i	will	watch	this	dvd	over	and	over	again	,	but	i	certainly	think	that	it	bears	watching	again	and	i	will	buy	it	just	to	spite	those	who	blindly	opposed	it	without	ever	seeing	the	movie	.	i	laugh	ruefully	at	those	reviewers	who	sadly	try	to	make	light	of	the	passion	with	crude	humor	.	not	because	they	are	funny	,	but	because	it	is	so	typical	of	those	who	do	not	believe	.	i	do	n't	find	it	offensive	,	but	i	am	afraid	god	will	.	he	will	not	be	mocked	,	which	i	suspect	will	be	discovered	to	the	chagrin	of	the	mockers	someday	.	i	find	it	odd	that	in	a	world	that	so	values	tolerance	above	any	other	virtue	,	mockery	of	the	savior	of	the	world	is	still	acceptable	.
as	with	almost	everyone	,	i	was	stunned	.	i	know	the	stations	of	the	cross	as	well	as	anyone	who	grew	up	catholic	,	and	i	know	the	gospels	as	well	any	baptist	.	however	,	like	chicago	sun	times	movie	critic	roger	ebert	,	i	was	connected	with	the	reality	of	the	suffering	christ	went	through	in	a	very	real	way	.	it	is	just	a	movie	,	and	the	guy	on	the	cross	was	n't	jesus	.	but	it	caused	me	to	think	about	jesus	in	a	whole	new	way	.	i	knew	this	was	coming	.	i	have	read	dozens	of	articles	on	this	and	tuned	into	every	show	on	the	movie	.	not	good	enough	.	it	still	hit	me	.	it	was	n't	the	blood	that	spattered	on	my	face	,	but	the	love	that	spattered	on	my	heart	.	i	sat	in	that	theater	as	a	christian	who	believes	,	but	i	experienced	something	very	heavy	that	evening	.	there	is	no	separating	my	christian	beliefs	from	my	reaction	to	the	movie	.	the	subtitles	take	nothing	from	the	experience	,	and	add	to	the	focus	on	the	movie	's	story	rather	its	dialogue	.	the	beginning	sets	the	dramatic	tone	,	delivering	us	into	the	garden	of	gesthemene	as	jesus	prays	.	judas	kisses	him	softly	on	the	cheek	,	and	a	fight	ensues	between	the	posse	of	soldiers	and	jesus'	disciples	.	jesus	himself	waits	,	and	even	heals	the	ear	wounded	by	peter	,	whom	jesus	rebukes	.	the	following	events	include	a	trial	and	flogging	.	jesus	never	raises	a	hand	or	comment	against	his	accusers	,	nor	does	he	deny	their	accusations	that	he	claims	to	be	god	.	pilate	is	torn	politically	,	wanting	to	do	the	right	thing	and	wanting	to	save	his	own	position	.	unwilling	to	assert	a	position	,	he	lays	the	call	onto	the	town	's	citizen	who	are	in	a	blood	frenzy	.	what	grabbed	me	in	the	movie	were	unexpected	scenes	,	like	jesus	and	mary	connecting	sight	on	the	via	dolorosa	.	jesus	stumbles	,	and	the	movie	flashes	back	to	mary	running	to	a	four	year	old	jesus	who	stumbled	in	a	field	.	she	picks	him	up	,	holds	him	motherly	.	now	,	jesus	is	33	,	all	battered	and	worn	from	a	vicious	,	sadistic	abuse	by	roman	soldiers	.	mary	runs	to	him	.	he	speaks	to	her	,	whispering	cryptically	,	see	mother	,	i	make	all	things	new	,	and	does	his	best	to	press	on	.	it	is	his	cross	to	carry	,	and	he	raises	to	his	feet	.	the	ending	is	ingeniously	subtle	.	in	some	ways	,	they	are	the	30	most	important	seconds	of	the	movie	in	which	it	all	comes	together	.	every	drop	of	blood	,	every	rejected	silver	piece	,	and	every	cross	dragged	furrow	in	the	road	to	golgotha	comes	together	in	probably	the	most	understated	yet	complete	climax	to	a	movie	i	have	ever	seen	.	i	understand	now	why	people	bought	tickets	for	friends	,	dragged	people	to	see	it	.	i	expected	to	be	blown	away	,	but	i	did	n't	expect	to	be	hit	at	my	core	on	so	many	different	levels	.	the	movie	is	n't	perfect	.	some	scenes	took	more	poetic	license	than	can	be	historically	supported	.	herod	was	decadently	different	than	i	expected	,	and	perhaps	the	least	like	the	real	herod	.	herod	's	lascivious	persona	here	matches	the	essence	,	if	not	the	exact	personality	.	his	reactions	to	the	christ	situation	were	consistent	with	the	bible	,	and	add	texture	to	pilate	's	dilemma	.	some	vague	scenes	confused	me	,	like	when	satan	carries	a	grimacing	,	sneering	man	child	.	however	,	as	satan	's	gender	is	not	important	to	his	evil	nature	,	the	androgyny	holds	up	.	a	knowledge	of	christian	scripture	will	augment	an	understanding	of	the	film	's	secondary	flashback	scenes	.	the	movie	does	stand	on	its	own	,	and	meets	the	vision	of	its	controversial	director	.	whether	the	audience	is	a	devout	believer	,	or	seeing	the	movie	as	an	artistic	portrayal	of	history	's	most	influential	figure	,	the	movie	will	work	.	i	expect	it	to	be	rerun	in	theaters	every	easter	season	.	i	fully	recommend	this	movie	.	anthony	trendleditor	,	hungarianbookstore	.	com
first	of	all	,	let	me	start	this	effort	by	saying	how	amazed	i	was	by	the	movie	,	and	by	its	sheer	emotional	power	.	it	is	superbly	shot	,	the	cinematography	literally	breath	taking	in	its	intensity	and	ability	to	add	muscular	heft	to	the	familiar	story	of	how	jesus	came	to	fulfill	the	prophecy	through	his	divine	sacrifice	on	behalf	of	all	mankind	.	the	movie	goer	is	sure	to	be	transformed	by	the	magnitude	of	the	oft	told	and	retold	tale	of	how	the	events	of	the	final	twelve	hours	focused	on	the	ways	in	which	jesus	deliberately	serves	himself	up	as	the	sacrificial	lamb	for	the	manifest	sins	of	the	world	,	offering	all	humans	the	opportunity	to	re	establish	their	contact	with	the	divine	from	whom	they	had	been	estranged	.	indeed	,	i	found	myself	almost	speechless	after	viewing	the	film	,	and	was	not	quite	sure	to	what	extent	it	was	a	result	of	the	power	of	the	film	's	message	as	opposed	to	the	graphically	violent	context	in	which	the	tale	is	told	.	herein	lies	the	single	criticism	one	can	level	against	the	film	,	which	despite	many	worries	from	bystanders	that	it	was	laced	with	virulent	anti	semitism	,	seems	to	clearly	blame	all	sinners	(	ergo	,	all	of	us	)	for	the	sacrifice	of	god	's	son	on	the	cross	.	yet	mel	gibson	's	sure	hand	is	both	able	and	accurate	,	and	the	violence	shows	how	carnal	man	greets	the	divine	,	and	how	we	react	to	the	message	of	hope	and	salvation	through	unspeakable	cruelty	and	gratuitous	violence	.	so	,	while	this	is	indeed	a	very	violent	movie	,	the	murderous	acts	depicted	quite	graphically	have	to	be	taken	in	the	context	of	the	supernatural	events	transpiring	,	as	a	kind	of	carnal	counterpoint	to	the	ethereal	repose	with	which	jesus	bears	all	of	the	acts	visited	upon	him	.	at	one	point	he	tells	mary	(	after	he	has	stumbled	under	the	burden	of	the	cross	)	quot	behold	,	mother	,	i	make	all	thing	anew	!	this	was	,	for	me	at	least	,	a	quite	stunning	reminder	of	the	godly	forces	at	work	amidst	all	the	violence	and	carnage	.	this	is	a	very	personal	interpretation	of	the	final	twelve	hours	of	christ	's	life	on	earth	leading	to	his	crucifixition	.	from	the	moment	it	opens	in	the	solitude	of	the	garden	at	gethsemane	,	one	is	immediately	aware	of	the	battle	ongoing	between	good	and	evil	,	as	the	devil	(	cleverly	presented	as	a	stunning	if	malevolent	woman	with	a	masculine	voice	)	attempts	to	dissuade	jesus	from	attempting	what	he	about	to	undertake	.	from	this	it	is	obvious	he	is	doing	this	for	all	mankind	,	jews	and	gentiles	alike	,	and	that	we	are	all	to	blame	,	through	our	unremitting	addiction	to	carnality	and	sinfulness	,	for	the	evil	manifested	in	the	world	.	this	is	a	fantastic	film	,	one	that	is	definitely	not	for	the	faint	of	heart	or	weak	of	stomach	,	and	definitely	not	something	i	would	suggest	subjecting	a	child	to	.	still	,	it	is	a	remarkable	work	,	and	one	that	deserves	the	very	wide	distribution	it	is	about	to	encounter	.
for	all	those	who	think	that	this	film	really	really	shows	the	suffering	this	jesus	guy	went	through	all	i	can	say	is	they	must	not	be	reading	their	own	bible	very	carefully	.	gibson	's	film	is	based	on	a	particularly	bloody	variant	of	the	passion	story	that	was	last	in	major	vogue	during	the	crusades	and	is	nowadays	espoused	by	the	same	group	of	religious	kooks	who	opposed	vatican	ii	,	as	well	as	objecting	to	the	catholic	church	's	apology	for	the	inquisition	.	essentially	,	this	film	is	entirely	about	the	craven	worship	of	violence	.	it	sucks	your	soul	dry	and	fills	you	with	despair	.	it	says	that	we	humans	are	worthless	,	despicable	creatures	who	delight	more	in	the	suffering	of	one	historical	figure	than	in	paying	attention	to	this	man	's	message	.	in	other	words	,	it	's	entirely	about	jesus	torture	and	nothing	at	all	about	his	best	message	love	each	other	.	a	real	shame	,	this	is	.	the	even	bigger	shame	,	i	think	,	were	all	the	parents	i	saw	exposing	their	children	to	this	pure	,	distilled	nightmare	fuel	.
my	whole	life	and	purpose	as	a	christian	is	to	follow	christ	,	there	is	no	peace	like	the	peace	i	know	when	i	am	in	close	relationship	with	him	.	he	is	my	all	,	my	everything	,	my	provider	,	i	do	,	i	truly	love	the	lord	.	i	was	24	when	i	watched	this	with	my	husband	and	i	still	can	remember	how	quite	the	movie	theater	was	,	all	i	could	hear	where	muffled	cries	,	sniffing	and	i	was	broken	beyond	words	,	i	was	touched	,	i	was	renewed	,	i	was	blessed	.	mel	gibson	did	a	perfect	job	.	this	is	by	far	the	best	movie	and	most	important	movie	that	will	ever	be	made	.	to	know	that	there	are	some	who	are	repelled	by	such	love	is	incomprehensible	,	but	you	know	gos	is	love	and	he	still	and	always	loves	us	all	,	the	weak	,	the	strong	,	the	christian	,	the	non	christians	,	that	's	how	amazing	he	is	,	love	unconditional	,	love	supreme	.	and	as	for	i	and	my	family	,	we	will	worship	him	as	long	as	we	live	.	to	him	be	the	glory	forever	and	ever	.	amen	!
i	saw	this	movie	and	i	was	blown	away	.	while	i	can	understand	the	controversy	,	i	never	fully	understood	just	what	jesus	did	for	us	until	i	saw	this	film	.	this	was	truly	a	great	man	.	as	a	bible	belt	resident	who	spent	18	years	in	sunday	school	,	i	already	knew	about	jesus	dying	for	our	sins	so	that	we	may	enjoy	eternal	life	,	so	i	was	not	too	impressed	with	this	part	of	the	story	,	no	,	what	amaazed	me	was	that	jesus	was	the	inventor	of	the	modern	table	.	i	have	read	the	new	testament	and	never	knew	that	jesus	first	had	the	idea	for	the	modern	table	.	i	have	two	bad	knees	,	so	this	really	raised	my	opinion	of	jesus	.	eternal	salvation	is	great	,	but	not	having	to	kneel	down	when	i	eat	,	wow	,	now	that	's	something	to	worship	a	man	over	.	also	i	would	like	to	thank	the	good	people	at	amc	theatres	for	reminding	me	that	nothing	goes	better	with	incredibly	graphic	images	of	our	lord	being	crucified	than	popcorn	,	diet	coke	,	and	some	penut	butter	m	ms	.
although	not	completely	accurate	,	it	's	the	best	and	most	realistic	film	of	the	suffering	and	crucifixion	of	our	lord	.	i	had	seen	it	the	day	it	was	released	in	theaters	,	but	this	was	only	the	second	time	i	've	viewed	it	.	it	made	for	an	interesting	experience	.	not	only	was	i	moved	and	drenched	in	tears	.	again	,	but	i	was	also	able	to	be	more	of	a	film	critic	this	time	.	i	noticed	they	reduced	the	amount	of	gore	and	injuries	on	the	body	of	jesus	.	it	would	have	been	much	worse	than	what	they	showed	.	not	that	that	was	their	fault	.	it	was	most	likely	advised	to	them	because	audiences	would	already	be	in	shock	for	what	they	were	seeing	.	i	would	rather	have	seen	it	the	way	it	actually	happened	,	but	this	telling	was	enough	to	get	the	desired	effect	.	as	you	watch	him	recieve	his	stripes	,	you	cannot	help	but	think	that	,	with	every	lash	,	another	disease	was	just	erased	from	our	life	.	all	our	sickness	was	taken	upon	him	.	i	doubt	that	mary	stood	under	him	and	was	sprayed	by	his	blood	,	but	overall	,	this	was	an	egrossing	and	powerful	viewing	experience	.	children	under	8	years	old	should	not	watch	it	,	unless	you	feel	they	're	truely	mature	enough	.	i	would	think	it	'd	be	too	much	for	their	young	minds	to	grasp	,	but	8	and	older	should	see	it	.	children	by	that	age	know	right	from	wrong	good	enough	.	they	should	see	what	it	took	to	have	all	their	wrongs	erased	.	it	might	make	them	appreciate	things	more	as	well	.	some	of	you	might	think	it	traumatic	for	a	child	that	young	to	watch	.	i	disagree	.	i	do	n't	think	god	would	let	that	happen	.	if	your	8	year	old	watches	this	film	and	has	nightmares	,	then	i	'd	be	fasting	,	praying	and	making	sure	my	own	life	was	in	order	.	because	if	that	is	the	case	,	it	's	not	the	film	that	's	giving	him	nightmares	.	it	's	evil	spirits	.	in	your	home	.	1	2	4	and	a	half	stars	(	to	earn	5	stars	it	would	need	to	be	scripturally	perfect	)
there	is	unfortunate	confusion	concerning	which	version	of	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	on	this	definitive	version	.	though	the	back	of	the	dvd	cover	only	mentions	the	recut	version	(	about	5	minutes	shorter	)	this	definitive	version	contains	the	original	version	as	the	one	you	see	when	you	hit	the	play	button	.	the	recut	version	is	to	be	found	in	the	special	features	section	of	the	main	menu	.	there	,	it	even	says	that	the	commentaries	are	only	available	on	the	full	length	version	,	not	the	recut	.	this	is	too	bad	that	this	definitive	version	is	so	poorly	described	on	its	own	back	cover	.	i	am	sure	that	it	has	diminished	sales	of	this	superior	definitive	version	,	since	you	ca	n't	tell	that	the	original	version	is	on	the	dvd	until	you	actually	get	it	home	and	watch	it	yourself	!	i	had	it	at	home	for	a	week	before	i	found	out	that	both	version	were	included	!	the	widescreen	is	best	for	the	passion	of	the	christ	,	of	course	,	since	some	scene	compositions	are	often	too	large	to	see	everything	going	on	,	if	you	are	watching	a	full	screen	dvd	.	this	is	most	notable	in	the	scene	when	the	serpent	is	stomped	on	,	a	real	crowd	pleaser	due	to	scriptural	references	,	but	in	the	full	screen	i	think	it	is	hard	to	even	see	that	the	snake	was	in	the	picture	!	the	definitive	version	only	comes	in	widescreen	.	this	definitive	version	is	years	overdue	,	in	my	opinion	,	but	at	least	it	is	finally	available	!	it	is	great	,	if	you	like	commentaries	and	making	of	documentary	material	.	there	is	about	100	minutes	of	short	making	of	topics	,	which	you	can	hit	play	all	to	watch	it	non	stop	.	this	is	all	good	,	and	what	you	would	expect	to	see	.	there	is	a	lot	of	insightful	information	concerning	the	filming	of	this	classic	masterpiece	film	!	then	there	is	another	half	hour	,	or	so	,	of	theological	video	documentary	material	,	not	specific	to	the	passion	of	the	christ	film	,	but	about	the	gospel	sections	that	are	shown	in	mel	gibson'	movie	.	the	commentaries	are	very	good	,	as	well	!	mel	gibson	appears	on	two	different	commentaries	.	the	first	one	is	dominated	by	mel	,	with	two	other	folks	who	made	the	film	with	him	,	and	there	is	another	commentary	with	mel	concerning	theological	concepts	.	mel	takes	a	back	seat	on	this	one	,	but	he	can	still	be	heard	every	once	in	a	while	,	but	it	is	still	a	very	interesting	commentary	,	though	it	may	be	heavier	on	catholic	concepts	than	even	the	actual	film	seems	to	be	.	it	is	still	very	interesting	.	i	learned	a	lot	from	all	of	these	bonus	features	!	for	instance	,	they	shot	most	of	the	film	using	different	frames	per	second	,	to	make	motions	look	more	graceful	.	also	,	there	's	talk	about	things	like	satan	's	old	baby	,	finally	explained	by	mel	!	this	shows	how	evil	mimics	good	things	,	but	when	you	look	closer	,	the	perversion	is	revealed	.	there	is	also	a	short	video	shot	of	mel	trying	to	coach	satan	into	licking	the	old	baby	's	face	,	which	satan	reluctantly	does	,	though	it	did	not	make	the	final	cut	.	this	definitive	version	is	a	must	have	for	any	fans	of	the	passion	of	the	christ	film	!	it	is	too	bad	that	it	is	confusingly	labeled	,	and	years	later	than	it	should	have	been	released	,	but	you	will	likely	forgive	all	that	after	you	have	gone	through	all	the	new	bonus	features	and	commentaries	,	and	you	will	have	understood	the	intents	of	mel	gibson	and	his	collaborators	much	better	,	and	maybe	even	pick	up	a	few	theological	things	that	you	might	not	have	thought	of	before	!
what	more	can	be	said	about	this	movie	?	it	has	become	a	symbol	of	adoring	love	for	so	many	(	and	judging	from	the	spitefully	pornographic	scribblings	of	a	few	reviewers	also	one	of	intense	hatred	)	.	all	of	us	who	were	raised	in	christian	households	,	who	went	to	catholic	schools	have	heard	and	read	the	words	scourging	and	crucifixion	.	we	've	seen	re	enactments	of	these	evils	in	passion	plays	,	we	also	watched	them	acted	out	in	previous	movies	on	the	life	of	jesus	.	but	it	took	mel	gibson	and	a	fantastic	actor	like	jim	caviezel	to	graphically	display	the	horror	of	what	these	truly	were	.	some	people	call	this	movie	disgusting	,	some	call	it	a	gorefest	.	well	,	that	is	what	gibson	intended	to	film	.	scourging	went	beyond	punishment	,	it	is	the	rendering	of	the	victim	into	a	symbol	of	broken	and	torn	submission	.	crucifixion	displays	the	victim	as	a	symbol	for	all	our	various	fears	of	death	and	pain	.	a	man	crucified	was	a	man	who	was	bound	,	broken	,	bleeding	,	slowly	suffocated	and	totally	helpless	to	the	fangs	and	beaks	,	claws	and	talons	of	every	nearby	carrion	eater	.	gibson	forces	us	(	the	spoiled	and	the	complacent	)	to	witness	this	.	i	thank	gibson	for	such	a	realistic	display	of	barbarity	and	evil	for	he	shows	us	what	we	all	are	truly	capable	of	doing	.	as	for	all	those	chicken	littles	in	the	jewish	community	who	feared	we	were	going	to	see	this	film	,	then	exit	the	movie	theatres	and	go	on	a	pogrom	spree	,	they	owe	mel	gibson	a	much	deserved	apology	.
i	ca	n't	imagine	being	alive	in	those	dark	times	.	this	was	a	startling	re	enactment	that	certainly	activated	my	capacity	for	compassion	.
there	's	nothing	quite	like	taking	a	universally	important	story	,	coveted	by	millions	of	people	,	and	turning	into	a	movie	which	makes	millions	of	dollars	.	the	source	material	itself	is	really	the	only	way	i	can	rationalize	its	success	.	the	movie	was	not	the	masterpiece	it	was	hailed	as	.	the	camera	movements	were	awkward	,	the	editing	horrid	,	the	slow	motion	unbearable	,	and	the	lighting	was	often	too	dark	to	even	guess	at	what	was	occurring	.	the	only	thing	this	movie	made	me	feel	(	and	this	is	my	personal	opinion	)	is	disappointment	.	i	was	disappointed	in	human	kind	.	from	this	retelling	of	jesus'	story	i	realized	how	his	name	is	used	in	vain	every	day	.	jesus'	teachings	went	completely	ignored	.	we	are	no	better	today	than	those	who	crucified	him	.	perhaps	that	is	a	bit	cynical	,	but	it	is	what	i	got	from	the	film	.	i	felt	terrible	for	jesus	because	his	death	seems	to	have	taught	us	nothing	.	and	to	answer	the	questions	before	they	are	even	brought	up	,	i	was	raised	catholic	but	decided	i	'd	rather	take	jesus'	advice	than	the	church	that	supposedly	follows	him	.
there	have	been	many	movies	that	i	have	seen	throughout	my	life	,	but	no	movie	has	had	such	an	affect	on	me	like	the	passion	of	the	christ	.	i	was	born	and	raised	as	a	catholic	and	over	the	years	,	my	faith	in	god	and	christ	has	always	been	strong	.	this	past	weekend	,	my	mother	,	father	,	and	i	took	ourselves	to	the	theater	to	see	this	film	.	after	the	movie	had	ended	,	i	felt	my	faith	grow	so	much	stronger	than	ever	.	the	movie	is	very	,	very	graphic	and	gory	,	but	that	only	goes	to	show	you	that	that	jesus	actually	suffered	that	badly	.	seeing	how	this	innocent	man	suffered	brought	immediate	tears	to	my	eyes	.	all	i	wanted	was	to	meet	the	real	jesus	and	just	give	a	huge	hug	.	i	cannot	say	for	sure	if	i	liked	this	film	or	not	,	but	i	gave	it	five	stars	because	of	it	's	outstanding	direction	that	was	done	by	the	famous	mel	gibson	.	james	caviezel	gave	an	unbelievably	incredible	performance	as	christ	himself	.	if	you	are	a	catholic	who	has	not	yet	seen	this	film	,	i	do	recommend	that	you	go	out	to	see	this	film	.	if	you	are	not	a	catholic	,	i	highly	recommend	that	you	go	out	to	see	this	film	.	but	i	must	warn	you	all	,	catholic	or	not	,	if	you	do	decide	to	see	the	film	,	i	can	assure	you	that	you	will	be	in	tears	throughout	the	entire	movie	.	when	i	saw	this	film	,	i	had	a	million	tears	streaming	down	my	face	.	i	even	cried	myself	to	sleep	.	go	out	and	see	this	film	and	you	be	the	judge	.
i	consider	myself	to	be	open	minded	and	a	huge	mel	gibson	fan	.	but	,	i	was	only	able	to	make	it	through	about	10	minutes	of	this	movie	before	turning	it	off	.	controversy	is	an	undestatement	about	the	story	,	the	message	,	etc	.	the	world	has	enough	darkness	.	so	,	i'm	going	to	stick	with	what	i	've	been	taught	,	and	leave	my	images	of	god	and	jesus	in	the	precious	state	they	are	in	my	mind	and	heart	.
there	are	two	different	approaches	within	christianity	when	it	comes	to	jesus	of	nazareth	.	the	first	focuses	on	the	teachings	of	jesus	especially	the	love	your	neighbor	part	.	the	approach	believes	very	much	that	jesus	came	here	and	he	had	something	to	say	.	the	approach	has	had	a	long	and	honorable	history	within	the	church	.	past	a	certain	point	it	begins	to	break	apart	as	far	as	exactly	what	it	was	jesus	had	to	say	but	it	is	generally	agreed	that	the	message	was	of	divine	origin	and	reflected	something	about	the	mind	of	god	.	in	this	regard	,	the	passion	of	the	christ	comes	up	short	in	that	it	is	devoid	of	clear	spiritual	teachings	.	even	the	flashback	to	jesus'	sermon	on	the	mount	seems	more	than	just	a	little	subtle	.	instead	we	have	a	gut	wrenching	account	of	jesus'	sufferings	on	the	way	to	the	cross	that	is	frankly	more	than	many	can	endure	.	indeed	,	many	members	of	the	jesus	giver	of	spiritual	wisdom	school	have	a	difficult	time	giving	the	crucifixion	a	meaningful	place	within	the	gospel	.	in	some	ways	,	by	this	viewpoint	,	the	whole	suffered	under	pontius	pilate	,	was	crucified	,	died	and	was	buried	part	of	the	apostles	creed	seems	more	a	distraction	from	the	message	of	jesus	than	an	illustration	of	some	moral	message	.	thus	several	reviewers	have	remarked	that	mel	gibson	has	utterly	failed	in	his	project	by	not	placing	the	story	of	christ	's	final	twelve	hours	into	a	larger	spiritual	framework	the	viewer	could	walk	away	with	.	but	there	is	a	second	approach	.	this	approach	believes	that	the	gospel	(	and	the	secret	of	life	for	that	matter	)	is	not	a	collection	of	spiritual	wisdom	or	a	code	of	ethics	and	conduct	.	this	approach	believes	that	the	secret	of	life	is	a	person	.	in	other	words	,	christ	did	not	come	to	walk	among	us	to	get	us	to	be	better	people	or	live	on	a	higher	spiritual	standard	.	christ	came	to	reconcile	us	to	himself	.	he	came	so	that	we	could	place	our	trust	in	him	and	trust	in	his	righteousness	to	make	us	acceptable	to	a	holy	god	.	in	this	view	,	gibson	's	movie	makes	sense	.	the	whole	drawn	out	tale	of	the	suffering	jesus	makes	sense	because	jesus	himself	is	the	point	.	it	offends	many	that	this	one	man	in	one	particular	time	and	concrete	place	is	believed	to	be	the	meaning	of	it	all	.	it	defies	all	reason	and	common	sense	.	yet	this	is	what	the	faith	proclaims	.	hence	at	least	some	of	the	criticism	this	film	has	received	is	actually	an	expression	of	outrage	at	this	very	suggestion	.	there	have	been	some	complaints	that	in	this	version	of	jesus'	death	that	the	roman	governor	,	pilate	,	is	viewed	with	some	sympathy	.	indeed	,	i	think	gibson	has	done	just	that	.	but	whatever	sympathy	gibson	shows	for	pilate	is	offset	by	the	ghastly	brutality	of	the	roman	soldiers	.	and	troubled	or	not	,	pilate	cannot	absolve	himself	of	his	part	in	the	crucifixion	by	washing	his	hands	anymore	than	he	can	declare	himself	a	bird	and	fly	away	.	at	the	viewing	i	attended	,	the	audience	was	dead	quiet	throughout	the	entire	film	.	no	one	ate	and	only	a	few	bothered	to	drink	their	sodas	those	that	did	did	so	only	to	calm	the	upset	in	their	stomachs	.	surprisingly	,	the	toughest	part	of	the	film	was	not	the	hanging	on	the	cross	but	when	jesus	is	beaten	with	a	variety	of	whips	.	to	watch	a	man	have	the	skin	ripped	from	his	body	is	an	astoundingly	harsh	experience	for	the	viewer	.	it	is	with	this	particularly	long	scene	in	mind	that	i	cannot	recommend	this	film	to	younger	filmgoers	.	this	is	a	painful	film	to	watch	.	most	of	the	audience	cried	at	some	point	.	a	few	had	to	leave	the	theater	.	when	it	was	over	the	audience	walked	out	not	speaking	to	each	other	.	this	film	is	meaningful	in	the	extreme	to	christians	long	familiar	with	the	habits	of	lent	and	easter	.	it	is	definitely	a	catholic	view	of	the	crucifixion	even	so	,	it	is	not	so	oppressively	catholic	that	members	of	other	denominations	would	find	it	distracting	.	most	leave	this	film	deeply	moved	and	without	regret	for	having	watched	it	.	only	time	will	tell	if	this	film	will	have	a	lasting	place	among	christians	.	i	can	scarcely	imagine	what	place	it	will	have	in	the	world	of	filmmaking	.	there	is	no	other	film	like	it	.	the	only	film	i	have	heard	it	compared	to	is	schnildler	's	list	in	its	depiction	of	brutality	.	it	could	be	for	that	very	reason	it	will	be	ignored	in	the	long	run	by	the	film	watching	public	.	like	schnildler	's	list	,	it	may	be	more	honored	than	watched	.	but	this	is	an	important	film	as	a	film	.	and	if	you	are	a	believer	it	will	knock	the	wind	out	of	you	.
what	i	liked	most	about	this	film	was	its	unpretentiousness	.	the	film	does	n't	pretend	to	be	anymore	than	it	is	a	thorough	examination	of	christ	's	passion	through	graphic	(	one	could	not	exactly	say	literal	)	depiction	.	because	of	the	film	's	intense	focus	,	i	gained	a	much	deeper	understanding	of	what	exactly	the	passion	of	the	divine	christ	was	his	absolute	,	uncompromising	,	and	,	most	of	all	,	completely	self	sacrificing	love	for	humanity	.	by	focusing	on	the	essence	of	christ	's	mission	,	in	a	brilliant	exposition	of	the	film	maker	's	art	we	are	shown	the	exemplication	and	demonstration	of	perfect	self	sacrificing	love	,	the	true	altruism	,	which	he	was	sent	into	this	world	to	teach	,	and	the	intolerably	brutal	and	vicious	way	in	which	we	treated	him	.	to	the	credit	of	the	film	,	we	are	not	allowed	for	a	second	to	forget	that	god	's	begotten	son	took	upon	himself	the	form	of	a	man	,	and	therefore	,	was	subject	to	that	human	sensitivity	which	experiences	pain	and	travail	.	and	who	among	us	,	with	all	the	agony	we	do	experience	,	could	have	endured	what	he	did	for	our	sake	?	herein	,	the	film	shows	us	what	christian	virtue	is	to	bear	our	cross	,	without	complaint	or	rebuke	.	the	film	really	does	a	superb	work	in	showing	us	that	christ	's	passion	for	our	betterment	was	great	enough	to	transcend	any	agony	which	we	could	inflict	upon	the	flesh	.	i	understand	the	heart	of	christ	's	teaching	as	stated	in	the	gospel	of	john	to	be	thus	1	)	.	that	you	love	each	other	as	i	have	loved	you	.	2	)	that	.	there	is	no	greater	love	than	this	that	one	might	lay	down	their	life	for	their	friends	(	or	enemies	,	or	anyone	at	all	)	.	what	i	do	n't	understand	is	how	one	can	watch	this	film	and	point	a	finger	at	anyone	,	jew	,	roman	,	iraqi	.	anyone	,	other	than	at	themselves	.	i	cannot	speak	for	anyone	other	than	myself	.	i	see	a	lot	of	people	really	trying	hard	to	live	christ	's	teaching	,	christian	and	non	christian	alike	.	but	,	i	,	for	one	,	know	if	someone	hit	me	with	one	of	those	scourging	whips	what	would	happen	.	i	cannot	speak	for	you	or	anyone	else	,	but	the	film	makes	me	lament	that	i	am	far	.	.	.	far	away	from	the	passionate	love	of	my	fellows	that	christ	died	see	in	every	person	,	and	lives	to	see	in	so	few	,	or	any	real	sense	of	that	truly	unselfish	.	.	.	selfless	.	.	.	contrition	that	he	might	deem	holy	,	or	even	acceptable	.
mel	gibson	's	new	film	the	passion	of	the	christ	has	been	greeted	with	as	much	controversy	and	anticipation	as	any	film	has	been	in	years	.	and	though	this	guarantees	the	film	will	make	huge	sums	of	money	from	the	curious	public	,	it	also	allows	religion	and	theological	clashes	to	overshadow	what	the	analysis	should	be	focused	upon	for	any	cinematic	offering	the	filmmaking	.	in	that	respect	,	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	very	similar	to	recent	critical	favorite	touching	the	void	.	for	the	former	,	we	see	an	hour	of	real	time	scourging	,	torture	and	crucifixion	.	the	latter	limits	itself	to	about	an	hour	of	battling	the	elements	,	as	a	horribly	injured	man	attempts	to	descend	a	perilous	mountain	.	the	problem	in	both	cases	is	that	an	ordeal	on	film	is	made	to	be	an	ordeal	for	the	audience	,	as	well	.	frankly	put	,	too	much	of	the	same	thing	eventually	becomes	boring	.	the	film	begins	with	terrific	atmosphere	,	as	jesus	(	jim	caviezel	)	,	who	claims	to	be	the	son	of	god	,	prays	in	a	mystical	forest	under	the	guard	of	his	disciples	.	jesus	knows	that	the	jewish	authority	,	the	pharisees	,	believe	he	is	a	blasphemer	and	want	him	dead	.	as	such	,	he	prays	to	god	mournfully	as	the	specter	of	satan	attempts	to	turn	him	toward	the	dark	side	while	jesus	is	at	his	most	vulnerable	.	eventually	,	the	pharisees	seize	jesus	and	a	brief	battle	ensues	.	jesus	shakes	the	determination	of	one	jewish	guard	when	he	magically	restores	the	guard	's	severed	ear	.	the	pharisees	eventually	bring	jesus	to	the	roman	ruler	of	the	land	,	pontius	pilate	,	demanding	he	be	crucified	for	going	against	their	established	religious	hierarchy	.	pilate	is	extraordinarily	conflicted	about	jesus	,	seeming	to	believe	in	the	qualities	jesus	claims	to	possess	.	he	sends	the	pharisees	away	to	seek	the	rule	of	herod	instead	of	his	own	,	though	herod	promptly	refuses	to	condemn	jesus	and	he	is	sent	back	to	pilate	by	the	increasingly	bloodthirsty	mob	.	knowing	that	refusal	to	follow	the	will	of	the	people	would	create	a	rebellion	,	pilate	begrudgingly	sends	jesus	to	be	scourged	.	however	,	even	that	is	not	enough	for	the	accusers	,	led	by	caiphas	.	what	follows	are	essentially	20	minutes	of	scourging	,	20	minutes	of	bearing	the	cross	up	a	hill	,	and	20	minutes	of	actual	crucifixion	.	the	film	currently	runs	a	bit	more	than	two	hours	and	gets	tedious	trimming	several	minutes	off	the	hill	walk	and	a	bit	from	the	crucifixion	would	certainly	improve	the	film	's	pacing	.	the	visuals	are	indeed	incredible	,	making	us	feel	as	though	we	are	actually	in	the	time	and	place	of	the	events	(	the	director	of	photography	and	production	designer	deserve	recognition	here	)	,	but	even	imagistic	richness	is	not	enough	to	counter	endless	repetition	of	the	same	thing	.	the	same	criticism	can	even	be	levied	against	caviezel	,	as	well	as	maia	morgenstern	and	monica	bellucci	(	mary	and	mary	magdalene	,	respectively	)	.	though	caviezel	totally	embodies	him	here	,	jesus	spends	much	of	the	movie	wincing	,	collapsing	or	heaving	.	both	marys	have	little	to	do	but	cry	as	they	watch	the	torture	unfold	.	morgenstern	has	an	expressive	face	and	captures	the	idea	of	a	mother	's	grief	well	,	but	neither	she	,	nor	in	particular	bellucci	,	have	a	whole	lot	to	do	in	the	movie	.	mel	gibson	's	direction	is	incredible	for	visual	splendor	,	but	his	ideas	for	pacing	and	variety	leave	much	to	be	desired	.	though	the	final	moments	of	the	film	are	uplifting	ones	,	as	we	do	see	jesus	come	back	to	life	after	his	corpse	was	entombed	,	it	seems	gibson	's	vision	for	the	film	was	limited	to	the	torture	jesus	endured	for	his	beliefs	.	though	it	is	no	consolation	to	a	bored	audience	,	one	can	only	expect	singular	focus	from	such	a	narrow	vision	.	regardless	of	what	people	may	be	saying	,	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	certainly	not	a	life	altering	experience	.	it	is	quite	simply	an	artist	's	interpretation	,	of	writers'	interpretations	,	of	ancient	stories	.	as	such	,	there	is	no	reason	for	adults	to	bring	children	to	the	film	in	the	guise	that	it	is	instructional	.	this	r	rated	film	is	certainly	more	deserving	of	an	nc	17	than	the	dreamers	.	far	from	the	stylized	mayhem	of	kill	bill	volume	1	,	this	is	pure	and	unadulterated	torture	that	perhaps	should	have	remained	limited	to	the	world	of	nightmares	.	final	grade	b
what	happened	before	jesus'	12	hours	of	life	ended	here	on	earth	.	all	of	the	interesting	answers	and	what	the	bible	tells	is	here	.	this	is	acurate	,	and	controversial	all	at	the	same	time	.	cazivel	's	acting	ability	of	how	jesus	was	here	on	earth	.	my	favorite	actor	in	the	great	dvd	is	the	actor	who	portrays	pilate	.	thast	actor	is	a	great	actor	.	enjoy	this	great	rather	graphic	and	intelligent	film	.	i	know	i	do	,	because	i	own	it	.
a	very	moving	film	.	it	was	hard	to	keep	form	crying	or	yelling	at	the	screen	during	certain	parts	of	the	movie	,	and	i	do	n't	normally	do	either	of	those	things	during	movies	.
as	a	viewer	of	the	x	files	at	some	points	in	my	life	i	always	liked	the	saying	at	the	end	the	truth	is	out	there	.	well	,	the	truth	is	out	there	and	for	alittle	less	then	10	you	can	see	it	on	the	great	silver	screen	.	it	is	the	bible	in	action	and	the	very	words	that	have	been	in	our	grasp	for	almost	2000	years	finally	put	into	a	language	that	we	can	understand	and	apply	personaly	in	our	lives	.	pope	john	paul	put	this	movie	in	his	review	so	clearly	and	evidently	by	saying	simply	.	it	is	as	it	was	.	also	mr	.	gibson	declares	in	the	most	profound	and	honest	way	that	not	just	jews	or	gentiles	are	at	fault	for	jesus	's	death	but	we	all	are	at	fault	.	this	movie	declares	what	many	missionaries	go	with	their	own	lives	at	stake	to	declare	the	gospel	and	say	that	christ	died	for	our	sins	and	we	are	only	saved	by	the	grace	and	love	that	took	him	to	that	hill	and	pinned	him	to	his	death	.	the	movie	does	start	at	the	climax	of	what	happened	to	christ	,	yet	it	shows	in	such	horrific	detail	what	christ	went	through	for	out	transgressions	.	in	the	most	true	solidarity	and	painful	humbleness	.	i	found	myself	in	many	ways	coming	out	of	mr	.	gibson	's	movie	saying	exactly	what	the	pope	said	.	it	is	what	it	was	whether	we	in	our	own	human	nature	want	to	express	our	shame	and	utter	disgusting	human	nature	also	known	as	fallen	nature	or	not	this	movie	shows	exactly	to	what	extent	love	can	truly	be	portrayed	in	the	most	pure	way	.	christ	loves	us	and	if	we	accept	that	he	died	for	us	then	we	have	eternal	life	and	that	is	what	this	movie	made	me	truly	understand	and	believe	.	praise	be	to	god	for	giving	gibson	the	courage	and	strength	to	make	such	a	movie	.	now	we	all	need	to	stop	pointing	fingers	at	him	and	look	at	our	own	selves	.	that	is	my	point	of	view	and	i	stick	to	it	.	god	bless	lt	lt	dz
this	is	one	of	the	most	bloody	,	graphic	films	i	have	ever	seen	.	the	torture	goes	on	and	on	and	on	.	it	's	really	over	the	top	.	they	should	rename	it	torture	of	the	christ	.	i	could	n't	see	the	point	of	the	film	.	yes	,	christ	suffered	a	terrible	price	for	our	sins	.	crucifixion	alone	is	a	very	horrible	,	painful	death	,	but	why	keep	showing	scene	after	scene	of	beating	and	whipping	and	torn	and	bloody	flesh	?	just	too	much	.	what	's	the	point	?	the	horrible	suffering	could	have	been	made	apparent	without	so	much	gore	and	so	much	time	devoted	to	it	.	i	am	dumbfounded	that	people	found	this	movie	powerful	and	moving	and	that	it	got	such	high	praise	.	this	is	one	of	the	worst	movies	i	have	ever	seen	.	not	much	entertainment	value	and	no	real	religious	value	that	i	can	see	.	just	a	torture	movie	dressed	up	with	religious	themes	.	sorry	,	it	did	n't	do	a	thing	for	me	.	the	only	redeeming	thing	about	this	movie	was	that	the	period	costumes	were	very	impressive	.	the	question	is	,	were	they	accurate	?	the	story	seems	to	be	mostly	accurate	,	following	the	biblical	account	,	as	near	as	i	could	tell	.	i	would	n't	recommend	this	movie	to	anyone	.	there	are	many	much	better	inspirational	movies	.	do	n't	let	kids	see	this	movie	it	will	be	very	disturbing	to	them	.	do	n't	bother	to	see	it	yourself	either	.	if	you	are	a	christian	,	there	are	much	better	ways	to	spend	your	time	.	if	you	are	n't	,	this	movie	probably	wo	n't	change	your	mind	.
i	've	a	lot	of	respect	for	mel	gibson	both	for	his	staunch	religious	beliefs	and	his	skill	as	a	director	.	i	thought	braveheart	was	a	very	well	directed	film	.	i	was	pleased	when	i	learned	that	jim	caviezel	was	being	cast	as	jesus	in	'the	passion	of	the	christ'	and	i	was	also	very	happy	when	i	noticed	that	he	had	brown	contact	lenses	in	his	eyes	for	the	part	.	i	could	never	understand	the	western	ised	attempts	in	previous	religious	films	to	give	jesus	blue	eyes	and	pale	skin	.	jesus	was	a	jew	from	nazareth	so	it	was	almost	certain	that	he	had	dark	skin	and	dark	eyes	.	anyway	,	i	considered	the	film	to	be	tough	going	because	of	all	of	the	violence	but	it	was	a	respectful	and	solemn	piece	and	made	you	feel	a	sense	of	revulsion	at	the	cruelty	that	was	endured	by	jesus	and	also	a	feeling	that	he	died	for	our	sins	which	gives	one	a	feeling	of	hope	also	.	caviezel	gave	an	honest	,	decent	performance	and	he	really	looked	as	if	he	was	suffering	as	the	passion	took	place	.	overall	,	a	good	film	but	for	a	few	criticisms	.	the	whipping	scene	went	on	for	too	long	.	i	know	that	we	had	to	see	the	full	extent	of	the	cruelty	suffered	by	our	lord	but	i	really	think	that	the	scene	entered	the	realm	of	snuff	,	it	was	that	excessive	.	another	thing	i	did	n't	like	was	the	scant	attention	to	showing	the	resurrection	surely	an	integral	part	of	the	whole	crucifiction	.	i	did	n't	like	the	way	the	film	portrayed	his	resurrrection	from	the	tomb	.	i	thought	it	was	sloppily	donefinally	,	the	only	other	piece	that	i	found	distasteful	was	the	crucificion	when	the	thief	beside	jesus	had	his	eyes	pecked	out	by	the	crow	.	i	thought	that	was	totally	unnecessary	also	.	overall	,	it	was	a	well	made	film	with	a	few	minor	flaws	.	i	would	watch	it	again	however	just	to	try	and	reinforce	a	few	beliefs	.
i	received	the	movie	within	the	said	time	,	also	received	the	movie	in	excellant	conditions	and	will	use	them	again	,	thank	you	.	dianne
the	twenty	minute	whipping	scene	grossed	me	out	.	stop	rewind	return	to	the	video	store	.	i	prefer	to	remember	jesus	by	the	way	he	lived	,	rather	than	the	manner	in	which	he	died	.	it	is	not	just	a	little	morbid	that	people	dwell	upon	the	crucifixion	a	pagan	punishment	.	when	i	was	going	to	sunday	school	,	they	taught	us	about	the	good	deeds	christ	performed	,	and	did	n't	focus	on	the	whipping	,	blood	,	guts	,	nails	etc	.	but	nowadays	religiosity	passes	for	true	compassion	and	people	shout	about	their	religion	like	a	tribal	identity	and	hate	all	the	other	tribes	.	it	's	about	belonging	to	a	big	organization	,	rather	than	a	personal	philosophy	.	people	want	to	be	a	part	of	something	bigger	than	themselves	.	this	movie	will	appeal	to	those	with	a	sado	masochistic	sexuality	.
no	movie	in	years	has	inspired	half	as	much	controversy	as	mel	gibson	's	labor	of	love	,	the	intimately	religious	movie	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	.	quot	a	gritty	,	dark	,	bloody	retelling	of	christ	's	final	hours	,	this	takes	the	old	cleaned	up	bible	stories	and	throws	them	out	.	instead	,	we	have	a	vivid	,	shocking	picture	that	you	wo	n't	be	able	to	forget	.	this	is	,	in	essence	,	a	cinematic	passion	play	we	are	shown	jesus	's	(	jim	caviezel	)	temptation	by	a	surprisingly	eerie	satan	(	rosalinda	celentano	)	,	and	his	arrest	by	the	romans	.	his	apostles	flee	away	,	leaving	his	mother	mary	(	maia	morgenstern	)	,	follower	mary	magdalene	(	monica	bellucci	)	to	follow	him	on	the	road	to	where	he	would	be	crucified	.	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	quot	was	one	of	the	unexpected	hits	of	the	last	year	it	had	a	tiny	budget	,	a	seemingly	small	fanbase	,	and	was	made	strictly	according	to	the	catholic	new	testament	.	but	it	struck	a	chord	in	people	not	just	the	subject	matter	,	but	the	fact	that	gibson	was	so	dedicated	.	much	to	hollywood	's	surprise	,	people	raced	to	see	the	controversial	flick	.	while	some	accuse	gibson	of	revelling	in	the	gore	,	with	a	little	bit	of	thought	his	quot	passion	quot	's	point	comes	through	.	it	's	horrifying	to	imagine	a	person	let	alone	an	incarnate	god	going	through	such	horrors	.	but	when	it	is	realized	what	the	point	of	all	that	suffering	was	for	,	it	becomes	a	work	of	beauty	.	the	biggest	problem	would	be	that	gibson	spent	little	time	on	the	idea	of	jesus	being	resurrected	,	which	was	the	whole	point	.	jim	caviezel	gives	a	stunning	performance	as	jesus	christ	.	whether	it	's	trying	to	pray	through	satan	's	prattling	or	speaking	to	mary	and	john	from	the	cross	,	caviezel	brings	every	scene	to	life	.	morgenstern	is	low	key	wonderful	as	the	sorrowful	mother	who	has	to	watch	her	son	killed	by	inches	.	and	the	beautiful	belucci	is	equally	outstanding	as	the	horrified	magdalene	.	yes	,	it	's	in	aramaic	and	latin	.	but	if	the	language	does	n't	hold	you	back	,	the	beauty	of	the	script	can	shine	through	.	and	gibson	's	direction	is	equally	stunning	,	utilizing	rapid	camerawork	and	plenty	of	flashbacks	to	make	jesus	's	struggle	even	more	poignant	.	at	times	the	table	scene	it	's	more	than	slightly	awkward	.	but	it	's	easy	to	forget	that	by	the	next	scene	.	it	's	a	shock	.	it	's	a	controversy	.	it	's	a	one	of	a	kind	film	,	based	on	a	part	of	our	culture	that	was	underrated	by	hollywood	.	it	's	gibson	's	dark	,	bloody	quot	passion	of	the	christ	,	quot	and	if	you	can	watch	something	with	some	serious	gore	and	straight	to	the	heart	acting	,	then	this	is	a	must	see	.
the	worse	,	the	better	.	that	was	certainly	gibson	s	aim	.	and	so	many	priests	from	many	churches	told	their	flocks	the	true	story	was	even	more	ruthless	than	gibson	s	,	for	our	sins	are	always	bigger	than	christ	's	pain	.	guilt	is	profitable	,	history	knows	.	the	handsome	gibson	has	become	disgusting	after	this	pedestrianly	medieval	film	.	the	accuracy	of	aramaic	and	latin	languages	scarcely	disguises	its	actual	instinct	a	sadomaso	picture	which	should	be	kept	inside	x	rated	sector	.	convicts	received	at	that	time	39	lashes	,	for	the	hebraic	law	forbade	40	lashes	.	romans	used	to	respect	local	standards	.	thus	,	pilate	washed	hands	and	gave	jesus	to	jew	high	priest	.	gibson	was	right	about	semitic	incrimination	,	in	case	there	is	guilt	indeed	or	somebody	to	be	accused	,	once	jehova	has	decided	to	sacrifice	his	own	son	.	therefore	,	we	should	thank	judas	for	our	redemption	.	unforgivably	,	by	all	means	,	gibson	s	bloody	commercial	taste	is	worse	than	jason	s	saw	.	let	s	see	this	picture	's	prestige	in	next	years	.	flavio	j	morsch	santa	cruz	do	sul	,	brazil

the	passion	of	the	christ	,	directed	by	mel	gibson	,	is	a	graphic	depiction	of	the	last	twelve	hours	in	the	life	of	jesus	.	although	christ	(	jim	caviezel	)	is	shown	to	have	healing	powers	,	the	jewish	leaders	see	him	as	a	trouble	maker	and	turn	him	over	to	the	roman	authorities	on	contrived	charges	of	treason	against	caesar	.	an	oft	told	story	,	it	is	gibson	's	vision	to	focus	on	the	horrific	suffering	christ	endured	on	the	day	of	his	crucifixion	.	since	religion	has	always	been	an	impassioned	issue	liable	to	start	wars	,	the	needless	controversy	surrounding	this	picture	arose	before	principal	shooting	had	begun	.	the	majority	of	the	film	's	jewish	characters	,	caught	up	in	mob	mentality	,	are	portrayed	as	self	righteous	and	uncaring	.	the	romans	fare	worse	,	with	most	of	them	behaving	like	bloodthirsty	boors	.	yet	,	history	cannot	be	rewritten	to	placate	sensitive	individuals	.	if	anyone	today	proclaimed	themself	a	messiah	,	would	we	not	condemn	him	in	exactly	the	same	manner	?	sadly	,	the	trite	screenplay	(	co	written	by	gibson	)	assumes	we	know	the	antagonists'	motivation	,	and	barely	touches	upon	jesus'	teachings	of	love	and	forgiveness	.	it	chooses	instead	to	glorify	the	barbaric	atrocities	of	our	race	in	lengthy	scenes	of	blood	drenched	torture	.	as	the	copper	eyed	prophet	,	the	usually	engaging	caviezel	has	little	to	do	but	gasp	in	pain	,	while	the	two	marys	drift	through	the	draining	story	in	tears	.	pontius	pilate	is	depicted	as	a	reluctant	judge	and	herod	a	fop	,	while	the	sporadic	appearance	of	a	female	but	deep	voiced	satan	seems	peculiar	and	out	of	place	.	gibson	also	co	produced	the	film	,	which	was	lensed	in	southern	italy	because	of	its	resemblance	to	ancient	israel	.	the	stained	teeth	and	coarse	clothing	give	the	film	convincing	period	detail	,	but	the	visuals	are	drab	and	without	colour	.	the	entire	movie	is	also	spoken	in	the	acerbic	aramaic	language	and	accordingly	subtitled	.	this	proves	to	be	only	mildly	distracting	the	rhythmic	score	and	too	frequent	sound	effects	of	twittering	birds	are	far	more	annoying	.	like	michael	cimino	's	infamous	heaven	's	gate	,	the	passion	of	the	christ	will	prove	to	be	gibson	's	artistic	folly	.	it	lacks	the	beauty	and	marvel	of	past	biblical	epics	,	offering	no	entertainment	or	educational	value	.	further	,	there	are	far	too	many	slow	motion	sequences	that	merely	accentuate	the	slow	moving	narrative	.	if	those	opposed	would	simply	ignore	rather	than	protest	,	the	film	would	come	and	go	soon	enough	.	but	the	curious	will	carry	it	for	the	first	few	weeks	,	until	interest	dies	down	and	this	pointless	and	uninspiring	film	is	laid	to	rest	in	a	sepulchre	.	one	can	only	pray	there	will	be	no	resurrection	this	time	around	.	rating	2	out	of	10	.
once	again	,	i	see	signs	of	the	new	dark	age	.	this	film	is	nothing	but	some	zealot	's	(	gibson	is	part	of	this	ultra	orthodox	catholic	sect	)	view	of	what	true	christianity	is	all	about	.	i	'd	rather	watch	hellraiser	vii	than	re	wating	this	bloody	,	boring	,	organized	religion	propaganda	.	people	do	n't	see	this	film	as	a	film	,	its	more	like	going	to	a	revival	meeting	than	going	to	a	movie	.	the	dogmatic	view	of	true	spiritual	enlightenment	through	pain	,	death	and	suffering	is	nothing	more	than	a	means	of	social	control	to	keep	the	disenfranchised	in	line	.	historical	evidence	proves	that	this	whole	crucifixion	story	is	suspect	.	sadly	,	people	are	so	hooked	on	their	own	suffering	as	a	means	of	proving	their	devotion	to	god	that	they	cannot	face	a	more	hopeful	and	uplifting	story	of	jesus	.	but	,	unlike	alot	of	critics	,	i	do	n't	want	to	ban	this	ode	to	bloodletting	.	that	is	the	religious	fanatic	's	method	of	handling	something	they	do	n't	like	.	this	film	is	not	a	piety	test	,	its	simply	a	poor	movie	based	on	a	suspect	story	.	god	knows	what	the	real	story	is	,	i	would	really	like	to	see	a	movie	based	on	historical	fact	rather	than	a	snuff	film	designed	to	scare	rubes	into	rushing	back	to	the	church	.
this	is	the	most	publicized	version	of	all	the	motion	pictures	that	portray	jesus	.	in	this	case	,	the	crucifixtion	.	the	media	,	through	commentary	and	reviews	,	have	exhausted	the	headlines	.	critics	have	traversed	from	a	devout	rendition	to	a	magnanimous	publicity	stunt	,	with	mr	.	gibson	taking	it	head	on	.	it	is	a	tremendous	film	and	an	absolute	must	see	.	yes	,	it	is	violent	.	years	ago	,	in	a	film	showing	christ	,	we	never	saw	his	face	.	then	it	was	a	young	and	energetic	jeffrey	hunter	.	a	mature	and	intense	max	von	sydow	.	and	so	on	.	now	mel	gibson	gives	us	jim	caviezel	as	a	bloody	and	suffering	man	or	messiah	.	the	choice	is	yours	as	you	view	this	film	.	but	this	contemporary	portrait	is	a	sign	of	our	times	.	perhaps	a	retrospective	on	what	we	have	become	.	the	production	with	its	originality	of	concept	works	well	.	you	would'nt	think	a	film	with	no	english	dialogue	could	hold	your	attention	.	a	cast	of	relatively	unknown	actors	do	a	superb	job	.	the	soundtrack	is	both	eerie	and	penetrating	.	elements	of	violence	are	not	arbitrary	but	well	thought	out	.	the	film	is	edited	for	a	trim	2	hours	and	should	be	seen	by	both	believer	and	non	believer	.	just	so	you	can	form	your	own	opinion	,	because	that	's	the	only	one	that	counts	.
this	movie	is	an	asolute	masterpiece	.	mel	gibson	has	trully	made	an	amazing	film	on	the	crucifixion	of	christ	along	with	his	temptations	and	more	.	how	you	rate	this	movie	in	my	opinion	depends	on	whether	or	not	you	are	christian	or	whether	or	not	you	believe	in	god	and	christ	's	crucifixion	.	varg	vikernes	needs	not	to	write	this	weak	ass	guy	carries	a	cross	after	hes	been	tortured	.	this	man	obviously	has	no	faith	and	for	him	to	diss	this	movie	as	well	as	the	bible	is	unnecessary	.	here	's	a	recommendation	buddy	,	if	you	do	n't	believe	in	christ	or	aer	n't	a	christian	,	what	's	the	point	of	watching	this	movie	?	and	then	what	's	the	point	of	posting	a	review	saying	that	it	's	a	piece	of	crap	and	typical	holywood	?	if	you	do	n't	have	faith	,	why	are	you	watching	this	?	that	review	really	frustrated	me	.	of	course	,	many	of	you	say	that	this	movie	was	just	made	to	make	money	,	but	i	dissagree	.	i	respect	the	fact	that	i	believe	that	gibson	made	this	movie	to	make	a	point	.	all	that	we	see	on	the	screen	is	exactly	what	's	written	in	the	bible	,	and	for	those	of	you	that	say	that	it	's	too	bloody	,	what	about	black	hawk	down	or	saving	private	ryan	?	this	movie	made	me	cry	but	reading	this	passage	in	the	bible	can	do	the	same	.	the	blood	was	there	in	the	real	crucifixion	,	so	why	should	gibson	remove	it	and	make	it	pg	13	or	pg	.	this	is	the	truth	.	and	the	blood	there	can	maybe	wake	us	up	and	let	us	realize	that	jesus	christ	went	through	all	of	thagt	pain	and	suffering	for	us	.	for	the	world	.	so	that	we	can	go	to	heaven	and	live	in	eternal	bliss	forever	.	so	,	the	blood	level	was	high	because	that	's	what	really	happened	.	and	if	someone	were	to	say	that	gibson	was	trying	to	make	us	feel	sick	,	i	doubt	that	because	a	lot	of	blood	would	come	out	if	you	got	whipped	like	he	did	or	got	nailed	to	a	cross	.	this	movie	is	a	masterpiece	and	it	depicts	the	truth	.
what	struck	me	christ	was	condemned	by	the	democratic	mob	,	while	few	aristocratic	,	more	gentle	individuals	tried	to	save	him	.	my	long	suspicion	is	that	mercy	is	an	aristocratic	value	.	christianity	appeals	to	this	aristocracy	of	the	spirit	,	which	is	often	a	gentler	spirit	.	no	wonder	that	many	original	christians	and	early	christian	martyrs	were	women	.	you	do	n't	need	to	be	a	christian	to	feel	for	christ	's	suffering	so	graphically	(	perhaps	too	graphically	)	depicted	in	the	film	.	it	is	violent	,	not	hiding	behind	pretense	.	it	will	be	disapproved	by	the	modern	western	progressives	who	believe	that	the	human	kind	is	inherently	good	.	they	think	only	a	bad	governance	or	dictators	(	like	hitler	or	stalin	)	make	it	bad	.	actually	,	christ	's	radical	message	was	the	reverse	.	the	human	nature	is	seriously	tinted	.	special	effort	is	needed	to	make	us	love	one	another	not	somebody	of	the	same	tribe	or	family	that	would	be	easy	,	but	the	enemy	.	how	is	it	even	possible	?	we	are	to	love	all	men	in	spite	of	the	fact	they	are	sinners	partially	because	we	know	we	are	sinners	ourselves	.	this	message	is	radically	different	from	the	organized	systems	of	self	righteousness	embodied	in	nationalism	,	religious	camps	,	and	political	parties	.	they	would	not	hesitate	to	crucify	christ	again	.	christianity	never	ceased	challenging	human	illusions	.	the	best	of	it	preaches	religion	of	the	spirit	,	other	worldly	,	preaching	charity	and	humility	,	trusting	providence	and	submitting	to	it	,	and	setting	its	heart	and	its	treasure	in	heaven	.	whereas	other	heroes	may	imagine	they	can	liberate	the	whole	humankind	,	christ	was	more	concerned	with	individual	human	souls	.	and	there	is	a	question	of	mercy	and	the	state	.	seems	to	me	,	mercy	is	an	aristocratic	value	,	it	is	opposite	to	the	self	righteousness	and	drive	for	revenge	,	which	are	the	things	of	democratic	mob	.	i'm	deeply	skeptical	about	the	ability	of	modern	state	apparatus	to	understand	its	enemy	,	or	even	the	ally	,	because	the	state	has	already	rendered	judgement	as	to	the	purity	of	its	own	intentions	.	i	'd	probably	have	preferred	myself	a	less	brutal	,	slightly	more	gentle	and	nuanced	film	,	but	i	think	this	one	is	very	good	,	powerful	film	.
i	wish	there	was	a	lower	rating	.	if	you	're	looking	for	the	most	gratuitous	depiction	of	depravity	available	since	the	uncut	caligula	here	you	go	.	actually	,	this	makes	caligula	look	like	a	saturday	morning	cartoon	.	i	fear	for	all	of	us	when	christians	find	this	movie	moving	in	any	other	way	than	bowel	moving	.	this	is	the	kind	of	christianity	that	the	witch	burners	had	.	anyone	who	has	read	and	understood	the	new	testament	will	be	disgusted	and	outraged	that	this	movie	was	not	only	made	but	encouraged	.	this	is	not	what	the	gospels	are	about	.	this	movie	is	not	historically	accurate	(	of	course	how	can	we	expect	accuracy	from	the	someone	who	made	braveheart	or	the	patriot	)	.	the	jews	are	out	for	blood	and	the	romans	are	just	doing	their	job	.	and	,	of	course	,	it	's	palestine	but	nobody	speaks	greek	.	this	is	historical	revisionism	on	a	biblical	scale	.	it	even	picks	and	chooses	it	's	way	through	the	gospels	,	so	it	's	not	anymore	accurate	a	depiction	of	those	than	an	evangelical	sermon	.	gibson	sought	to	create	nothing	more	than	controversy	.	i	find	it	disturbing	that	any	christian	would	praise	this	filth	.	apparently	it	's	big	with	the	fundamentalists	,	but	they	also	pick	and	choose	their	way	through	the	bible	,	so	that	is	n't	suprising	.	it	also	seems	to	be	a	big	hit	with	the	s	m	crowd	.	hmm	.	so	what	's	next	for	gibson	,	a	revisionist	version	of	auschwitz	maybe	,	with	mel	in	the	role	of	rudolf	hoss	?	avoid	this	movie	or	avoid	lunch	.	but	that	's	just	my	opinion	.
i	viewed	this	film	the	other	night	when	i	had	nothing	better	to	do	.	the	film	is	passable	but	it	is	too	graphic	,	particularly	the	scenes	depicting	the	scourging	of	christ	.	i	think	this	worst	than	third	degree	torture	is	purely	cinematic	and	has	no	relevance	at	all	in	the	punitive	sentence	accorded	to	christ	himself	.	reviewing	the	sourging	scenes	in	more	leisure	time	,	i	think	jesus	would	have	died	than	and	there	with	such	cruel	method	that	was	used	on	him	.	this	coupled	with	lack	of	sleep	,	drinking	water	and	eating	,	he	would	not	be	able	to	even	walk	straight	up	and	much	less	carry	the	heavy	wooden	cross	at	all	!	i	think	the	picture	is	rather	an	exaggeration	and	too	graphic	to	convince	me	as	a	christian	.	well	.	who	am	i	to	urge	the	commercial	techniques	used	by	hollywood	.	on	the	whole	,	the	film	is	better	than	the	fabrication	and	untruth	betrayal	of	our	lord	jesus	christ	in	other	later	films	about	him	by	hollywood	which	are	tantamount	to	insult	of	christianity	and	a	great	affront	to	the	truth	of	jesus	christ	saviour	of	mankind	.
