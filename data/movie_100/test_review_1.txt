henry	winkler	is	very	good	in	this	twist	on	the	classic	story	.
this	has	been	a	favorite	movie	of	mine	for	a	long	time	.
this	is	the	american	adaptation	of	the	charles	dickens'	classic	.
this	is	a	wonderful	movie	.
anorher	good	movie	for	holiday	watchers	.
i	must	confess	to	being	a	bit	of	a	coinsure	of	dickens'	classic	tale	.
most	of	us	remember	henry	winkler	in	the	role	of	arthur	the	fonz	fonzarelli	on	happy	days	.
he	did	a	great	job	as	a	scrooge	type	character	.
henry	winkler	does	a	great	acting	job	as	he	protrays	34	mr	.
henry	winkler	is	the	one	of	the	best	scrooge	i	've	seen	!
not	the	best	quality	dvd	,	but	it	's	a	great	story	.
very	well	done	,	henry	winkler	is	a	smooth	guy	.
it	is	pretty	much	the	traditional	scrooge	story	,	but	set	in	america	in	about	1880	.
though	this	interpretation	of	joseph	's	life	has	been	substantially	embellished	,	the	heart	and	soul	of	the	story	remain	intact	,	and	is	ultimately	quite	faithful	to	the	biblical	account	covered	in	genesis	ch	.
a	movie	never	presents	a	story	exactly	as	you	envisioned	it	,	but	nevertheless	,	every	movie	version	you	see	gives	you	new	insights	into	the	story	.
if	it	were	n't	for	the	seduction	scene	with	potiphar	's	wife	,	this	movie	would	have	been	excellent	.
i	thought	the	movie	was	sufficiently	close	to	the	bible	story	.
this	is	my	go	to	movie	for	when	i	need	to	be	humble	.
i	really	loved	this	movie	,	it	describes	the	biblical	account	pretty	accurate	.
very	good	movie	.
joseph	clearly	tells	how	god	can	use	anyone	.
this	is	a	thanksgiving	tale	that	begins	with	the	ship	mayflower	being	caught	up	in	a	big	storm	.
for	more	about	rankin	bass	and	rudolph	,	check	out	the	books	and	blog	of	author	expert	rick	goldschmidt	,	who	helped	save	the	peppermint	mine	scene	.
i	loved	this	movie	as	a	child	and	miss	seeing	on	tv	now	days	so	i	found	it	here	and	purchased	.
my	husband	and	i	watched	this	when	we	were	childen	.
i	was	pleased	to	see	this	video	when	it	first	came	out	and	i	recommend	it	very	much	.
the	only	thing	you	can	do	is	love	this	classic	.
i	gave	this	5	stars	because	it	is	an	excellent	classic	to	add	to	your	christmas	dvd	collection	for	children	both	young	and	old	!
the	little	drummer	boy	deserves	a	place	alongside	rudolph	and	frosty	as	one	of	rankin	bass	's	vert	best	holiday	classics	,	and	where	it	may	lack	in	eye	candy	and	whimsy	compared	to	other	holiday	favorites	it	more	than	makes	up	for	it	with	a	truly	powerful	and	touching	story	.
loved	this	movie	as	a	child	and	my	kids	loved	this	movie	.
i	bought	this	for	my	grandson	.
this	was	a	gift	for	my	husband	for	year	before	last	christmas	!
i	could	never	remember	what	the	title	of	this	show	was	growing	up	although	i	always	loved	it	.
i	bought	this	cause	i'm	just	feeling	very	nostalgic	this	year	.
i	was	n't	so	thrilled	with	this	show	as	a	kid	and	i	guess	i'm	still	not	.
this	is	a	dvd	that	every	family	should	own	.
as	with	frosty	the	snowman	i	heard	the	song	and	then	saw	the	tv	special	.
as	his	stop	animation	alter	ego	,	sam	the	snowman	,	the	legendary	burl	ives	narrates	this	sweet	and	cutesy	1964	classic	about	how	a	red	nosed	reindeer	(	voiced	by	billie	mae	richard	)	,	a	toy	making	elf	who	wants	to	be	a	dentist	(	paul	soles	)	,	and	a	group	of	misfit	toys	(	voiced	by	carl	banas	and	corinne	conley	)	who	must	all	discover	their	own	niches	in	a	world	to	which	they	do	n't	easily	conform	.
recomendad	iacute	ssimo	!
i	do	n't	know	what	some	people	were	sent	.
there	is	a	lot	to	like	with	this	blu	ray	which	i	just	viewed	today	.
he	's	not	just	a	misfit	you	nitwit	!
wow	this	is	a	dvd	?
this	is	a	lovely	story	for	christmas	time	made	in	a	special	animated	technique	.
this	is	a	christmas	cartoon	classic	.
it	would	n't	be	christmas	time	without	rudolph	and	santa	claus	is	coming	to	town	.
this	is	one	of	those	christmas	movies	that	you	ca	n't	get	through	the	holiday	season	without	seeing	at	least	once	.
this	bluray	is	an	improvement	over	the	dvd	.
rudolph	is	a	cute	movie	.
this	movie	is	a	tradition	in	our	house	,	so	having	the	dvd	which	is	remastered	is	great	to	have	.
i	had	to	order	this	,	in	order	for	my	wife	,	and	the	others	,	on	the	chambers'	christmas	parade	float	committee	could	see	the	characters	in	the	movie	and	what	costumes	had	to	be	made	.
years	ago	,	some	friends	of	ours	sent	us	a	vhs	tape	taped	off	the	air	which	had	several	christmas	classics	including	emmet	otter	's	jug	band	christmas	,	frosty	the	snowman	,	the	grinch	,	babar	father	christmas	,	and	of	course	the	tried	and	true	rudolph	.
while	i	agree	that	it	would	be	great	to	have	underdog	and	friends	in	the	original	format	and	line	up	,	this	set	is	by	far	the	best	yet	of	the	caped	,	canine	crime	fighter	.
when	i	was	just	a	little	boy	,	my	heart	was	filled	with	glee	whenever	my	friend	underdog	appeared	on	my	tv	.
underdog	was	one	of	my	all	time	favorite	cartoons	back	in	the	day	,	and	this	dvd	trio	has	a	nice	sampler	of	the	canine	crusader	's	finest	.
julia	is	delightful	,	as	always	.
love	the	dvds	.
i	suspect	that	most	christians	already	owned	a	copy	of	mel	gibson	's	the	passion	of	the	christ	.
as	anyone	can	see	just	from	the	comments	,	jesus	is	the	still	most	important	person	ever	to	live	on	earth	.
well	this	is	one	of	the	best	gore	movies	i	have	ever	seen	.
i	was	hoping	for	more	.
i	love	this	movie	evertime	i	watch	this	movie	i	still	cry	the	soundtrack	to	the	movie	was	so	so	but	the	music	work	better	in	the	movie	then	on	the	soundtrack	i	think	anyway	.
the	truth	as	i	know	it	,	i	cry	everytime	i	watch	this	movie	,	great	doing	business	with	saler	,	was	fast	.
assuming	you	know	the	story	(	and	one	hopes	most	of	us	do	)	i	felt	you	had	to	be	neither	religiously	inclined	,	or	interested	in	historical	theology	to	take	a	lot	away	with	you	after	seeing	this	picture	.
i	watch	this	either	on	good	friday	or	holy	saturday	to	remind	myself	of	christ	and	the	passion	.
'the	passion	of	the	christ'	is	probably	one	of	the	most	precise	,	finely	crafted	films	in	terms	of	both	presentation	and	implementation	.
gibson	created	something	of	enduring	magnificence	.
few	films	have	been	as	highly	touted	or	as	deeply	vilified	as	the	passion	of	the	christ	,	and	for	good	reason	.
as	with	almost	everyone	,	i	was	stunned	.
first	of	all	,	let	me	start	this	effort	by	saying	how	amazed	i	was	by	the	movie	,	and	by	its	sheer	emotional	power	.
for	all	those	who	think	that	this	film	really	really	shows	the	suffering	this	jesus	guy	went	through	all	i	can	say	is	they	must	not	be	reading	their	own	bible	very	carefully	.
my	whole	life	and	purpose	as	a	christian	is	to	follow	christ	,	there	is	no	peace	like	the	peace	i	know	when	i	am	in	close	relationship	with	him	.
i	saw	this	movie	and	i	was	blown	away	.
although	not	completely	accurate	,	it	's	the	best	and	most	realistic	film	of	the	suffering	and	crucifixion	of	our	lord	.
there	is	unfortunate	confusion	concerning	which	version	of	the	passion	of	the	christ	is	on	this	definitive	version	.
what	more	can	be	said	about	this	movie	?
i	ca	n't	imagine	being	alive	in	those	dark	times	.
there	's	nothing	quite	like	taking	a	universally	important	story	,	coveted	by	millions	of	people	,	and	turning	into	a	movie	which	makes	millions	of	dollars	.
there	have	been	many	movies	that	i	have	seen	throughout	my	life	,	but	no	movie	has	had	such	an	affect	on	me	like	the	passion	of	the	christ	.
i	consider	myself	to	be	open	minded	and	a	huge	mel	gibson	fan	.
there	are	two	different	approaches	within	christianity	when	it	comes	to	jesus	of	nazareth	.
what	i	liked	most	about	this	film	was	its	unpretentiousness	.
mel	gibson	's	new	film	the	passion	of	the	christ	has	been	greeted	with	as	much	controversy	and	anticipation	as	any	film	has	been	in	years	.
what	happened	before	jesus'	12	hours	of	life	ended	here	on	earth	.
a	very	moving	film	.
as	a	viewer	of	the	x	files	at	some	points	in	my	life	i	always	liked	the	saying	at	the	end	the	truth	is	out	there	.
this	is	one	of	the	most	bloody	,	graphic	films	i	have	ever	seen	.
i	've	a	lot	of	respect	for	mel	gibson	both	for	his	staunch	religious	beliefs	and	his	skill	as	a	director	.
i	received	the	movie	within	the	said	time	,	also	received	the	movie	in	excellant	conditions	and	will	use	them	again	,	thank	you	.
the	twenty	minute	whipping	scene	grossed	me	out	.
no	movie	in	years	has	inspired	half	as	much	controversy	as	mel	gibson	's	labor	of	love	,	the	intimately	religious	movie	quot	the	passion	of	the	christ	.
the	worse	,	the	better	.
christ	's	true	message	of	love	and	redemption	is	completely	lost	in	this	bloody	,	torture	filled	horror	show	.
the	passion	of	the	christ	,	directed	by	mel	gibson	,	is	a	graphic	depiction	of	the	last	twelve	hours	in	the	life	of	jesus	.
once	again	,	i	see	signs	of	the	new	dark	age	.
this	is	the	most	publicized	version	of	all	the	motion	pictures	that	portray	jesus	.
this	movie	is	an	asolute	masterpiece	.
what	struck	me	christ	was	condemned	by	the	democratic	mob	,	while	few	aristocratic	,	more	gentle	individuals	tried	to	save	him	.
i	wish	there	was	a	lower	rating	.
i	viewed	this	film	the	other	night	when	i	had	nothing	better	to	do	.
